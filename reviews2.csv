I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT  ) this is very important detail, it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!.  I will also say their after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important.  Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business,  I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation,  Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone,  is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However,  for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with  90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and  as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice  addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors,  I will say as they are sufficient,  I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so  my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending  that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience.  I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation,  Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty,  and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!

I got mines for a good price around $385. No scratches on the front screen nor the back or the sides. Battery life is good the only side effect I found was that it heats up pretty fast. Every app works perfectly fine. If you are looking for a bigger size phone I wouldn’t recommend the iPhone 11 Pro but I would recommend the iPhone pro MAX just a few dollars more wouldn’t hurt for a good value. It came with a charger and a USB cube but I would also recommend to get a legit apple cord and usb cube to charge the phone. Please read the instructions when you buy this phone, the cheaper ones are the ones that are a little big damaged and the higher prices are the ones that aren’t.Over all I give it 5 stars because it works as great as my iPhone 12 :)

It’s way better to get Amazon renewed compared to any old joe of a company selling it but they still don’t go by everything they promise. I ordered this and it has scratches on the camera lens and it’s banged up, but other than that the whole exterior is great. The only problem is they boast a 90% battery health or above for AR but mine came at 85%. Not a super big deal to me but if that’s something you’re concerned about then make sure you know what you’re getting into.

Phone works great...But calls & songs were muffled through the speakers...I cleaned them all myself using a hack from youtube and now it's working great...I just wish they had be cleaned before I received the phone...To me a refurbished phone should also be a clean phone...I didn't find this problem till the phone was all set up and I had made/received a phone call...Thankfully there was a simple fix and it wasn't more complicated...5 stars for the phone and 4 stars for having to do the work myself.

Advertisement said 80 percent charged, arrived 20 percent leaving me skeptical. After a charge and the store activating the phone, I have zero complaints so far. It's been a few days battery life is that of my old phone. Also my phone came a day early, that was cool. I was nervous I'd get a bootleg phone a d I did NOT. worth the purchase

I don't know but this product is 100 recommend I receive the phone with a screen protector and no scratches battery life was at 93% but it's okay but one thing is that I didn't come with a Sim tool it only came with the phone and the cable charger and USB port  but I was so scare about the review and everything but everything was alright the phone work good bit I was expecting a bigger size but I still okay.

I switched from a iPhone SE to iPhone 11 pro. I bought this iPhone in a rush because who can live without their phone. Phone works great, and all the features work well. No scratches on the device and set up was like new. Exactly what I expected, if hesitant just buy, you will not regret it.Battery percentage was 80 percent capacity when received, which is kinda low, but charger stays charged longer than my last phone.

Compré este iPhone y funciona bien aunque tengo que decir que tuvo varios puntos en contra y es que al comprarlo me decidí por el reacondicionado en excelente estado y al recibirlo me encontré con que tiene 2 golpes el las esquinas, los aros que rodean a las lentes tienen raspones (pero las lentes están en excelente estado) y en la parte de atrás trae otro ratón mas. El reacondicionado excelente dice que golpes o ratones no se distinguen a un brazo de distancia pero si se notan y mucho en especial los de la esquina. Otro de los puntos en contra es que al pasar mis apps y archivos de mi antiguo iPhone me marcaba un error y me hizo restaurarlo 3 veces por lo que decidí iniciarlo como un iPhone nuevo y después descargar Lemus apps y documentos por iCloud. Hasta ahora el celular no ha teñido problemas de red, sistema y batería y con las fundas parecería nuevo así que decidí quedármelo a menos que en lo que resta de garantía me falle.

I got this renewed in excellent condition from Olympicwireless and it came the next day by Amazon shipping and this phone looked close to new as possible. Battery life was at 88% which is reasonable since its a few years old. Physicially I was very impressed and the phone worked fine as should be. Really happy. As for the iphone 12 , it is definitely faster from iphone 11 which I had a hand me down from a family member. I have used many android and previous versions of iphone and I must say iphone is easier to use in my opinion. Also a lot of reviews on Amazon don't mention the seller when it comes to renewed/refurbished and the listed condition that was bough but this makes a big difference for others looking for reviewed so would be great for others to mention this.

I believe I got lucky and got what feels like a brand new iPhone 12. I know the phone is old and I really am under the impression I got a brand new one that was sitting around for a while. Everything works fine and I’m really happy that when checking the battery health, it said 100%! I checked under direct light for scratches and scuffs. There was some minor scratches; very thin which looks like finger nail scratches. But from arm lengths distance, I couldn’t make out where the scratches were and I’m happy with it. My Samsung Galaxy S10e of 2.5 years malfunctioned recently and I needed a new phone but I didn’t want to break the bank.I did a lot of research prior to purchase on which older model was more “bang for your buck.” I found that the iPhone 12 in 2022 was a worthy  purchase considering it has a great camera, pretty display and the potential to see several more years of support from Apple (support being firmware updates which tend to include new features to your phone’s software). Nothing is guaranteed but a lot of people mentioned much older iPhones are still receiving updates. I do have a case on it but I don’t prefer any screen protectors because I want the most out of the display. If I break it, my carrier will fix it for a low cost.From now on, I’m going to buy older models of phones to save money and hope I get a quality phone like this one!

this is my second iPhone and I just upgraded from the 11. This one is noticeably faster and the camera is better but the battery is still okay at best. my daily driver is an android phone and that battery outlives this one every single day. even with game play on that one. I really like the camera tho. I bought it to test my app so it works for the purpose I got it. (the pic is from an android phone - forgive me lol)

I believe face recognition is faulty. My phone and sites can be accessed by others than myself😵‍💫. I went from iPhone 8+ to iPhone 12 simply for the 5G network. I was more comfortable with the finger print more so than face recognition.I feel the battery life is very short even though I may not use it for hours and hours however it prompts me of status and I have to recharge come bedtime. I am not routinely on my phone much if at all during the day.It took some learning but finally managed to fix where I can open my phone with passcode rather than ‘swipe up’ which as stated anyone could do and use my phone with the faulty face recognition 😬.

When I bought the cell phone I didn't want to give my opinion because I hadn't tried it enough, it's been a while, I think I can give my opinion now, it works perfectly. the battery lasts a full day, the functions work well. I recommend buying it, especially thinking about the environment, greetings from Costa Rica.

Unfortunately I dropped the phone without a case and dented it a little bit on the first day I got it, so I couldn’t get any pictures of the pristine condition it came in. I didn’t see a single scratch or dent anywhere on it when I pulled it out of the box. The speaker and microphone grills were completely clean and shiny, the battery health is at 100%, and it came with a screen protector already installed with no air bubbles! It didn’t come with a charger but I don’t think apple includes one with a new iPhone anyway. Long story short Im extremely satisfied with my purchase.

The product packaging was surprisingly good, the exterior of the phone seems to be in Very Good condition, practically untouched apart from a few scratches above the front camera in the notch. I bought a Used - Good phone, and it came with 85% battery. And yes it is a legit, Unlocked, Apple Certified smart phone. Would have loved to see a biggger battery capacity, but you get what you pay for and overall I’m immensely satisfied.

So so happy with this purchase. I got this on a black friday sale so it was at a great discount. My old phone had become an absolute nightmare even though I'd only had it for 3 years because of poor storage (just 32 Gb), so every time I open ""iphone storage"" in my settings and see 256 GB, I get pretty giddy lol. Storage was really the most important factor for me when purchasing this, so I'm happy with my purchase.

Phone arrived in a generic box but was well packaged. I do feel that for the product I received, the claim of “the screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away"" is being stretched a bit. There is damage on the bottom and right sides of the body of the phone where the paint has been chipped off. I don’t particularly mind these as much, because I will be putting a case on the phone, but it is worth mentioning. My major gripe with the phone I received is the scratch in the screen that you can very clearly see when it’s turned on. It’s a bit disappointing.I have no complaints with the functionality of the device. It has 89% battery health, which could definitely be better, but it’s alright. It came unlocked, with the amount of storage I paid for, 256gb.  Camera, speakers, etc. all seem to be in great working order. I needed a replacement after my 1st gen SE died on me, and this one is a great upgrade.

I love the light weight and smaller form factor compared to most modern phones. Setup was easy, switching from Android was not difficult. Mine arrived with 93% battery health, quite good for an older device, though the device also arrived without any charge at all, so don’t plan to use it immediately. The speaker is not good and drains your battery quite substantially. The device physically shakes at high volumes; this phone is best used with headphones for music and video consumption. The device is fast, the screen is quite crisp, and the fingerprint reader is very reliable. The device also came with very little bloatware, and unlike with Android, you can uninstall almost everything rather than just disabling the apps.My impression of the phone is quite favorable, though some of Apple’s choices with their software are just a bit silly. The settings for some apps aren’t as granular as they are on Android. If you don’t wholly live in Apple’s ecosystem and consume technology exactly as they think you should, there will be a bit of a learning curve. That’s more an issue with the current status of the software across all Apple devices than an issue with this phone specifically and there are ways to adapt to and work around it.

I previously purchased from Amazon Renewed an iPhone 5s, and was satisfied with it considering the price was barely over one hundred dollars. That phone, however, was originally released in 2013, and at 8 years old it was getting hard to justify its continued use.So when the new iPhone SE (2020) was released I was really tempted to get it, but the pandemic had basically stopped any purchasing of anything for me at the time. Now in September of 2021, with the battery in my old phone failing, it was time to do something.I decided to check out what Amazon might have in their ""renewed"" products and was surprised to find that they now have ""Renewed Premium"", which offers a year's satisfaction guarantee. That meant, in my mind, I could send this thing back if it wasn't good or turned out to be a lemon, so I sprung for it.First of all, this one came in a nice box, oversized, and obviously sturdy enough to protect everything inside. It comes with an information packet describing what ""premium"" means, along with a quick start guide. The inclusion of a standard wall charger was nice, but I have a number of chargers already, not to mention my iPad Pro charger. I'll get back to that in a minute.Another thing that was nice to have included was a tool for removing the SIM card tray. Nice, but it turns out that with the new iPhone SE you can use eSIM! More on that as well in a minute.Now first of all...  This phone looks gorgeous. The red color and the black front make for an awesome combination. All surfaces are smooth as if it was a brand new phone. Turning it on shows the screen is working perfectly, with even back lighting all across to each corner.The first thing I checked was the ""battery health"". Amazon promises that with their renewed premium phones the battery would at least be at ninety percent of capacity, so I immediately checked.Ninety-eight percent! Eight percent better than what they promised. Not bad at all!So it turns out that this phone supports fast charging. So that means my phone gets charged on the desk where my iPad Pro sits, because the charger for that is a high capacity charger. The iPhone SE charges up easily in a little over an hour, which means no need to plug it in over night. In fact, I plug it in before bed, but it's plugged into an outlet controlled by Alexa and that wont come on till in the morning. The phone charges up to capacity before I go to work!Now for setting up the service, the iPhone SE (2020) supports eSIM, which means getting set up with Mint Mobile (or any service that supports eSIM) was as easy as...  Well, I went to Mint Mobile's website, checked my location, checked phone compatibility, chose my service plan, then chose eSIM at check out. A few minutes later a QR code appeared on the screen of my computer that I scanned with the iPhone SE, and a few seconds later I had 4G/LTE and everything ready to go.eSIM is the way to go. It is, just trust me on that.After about a week of using the phone, on some days like I normally do and on other day literally trying to cause it run dry of battery or trying to get it to malfunction, this little phone is holding up way better than I could have anticipated. I believe I can safely say my iPhone 5s can be retired for good.By the way. Get a cover. This phone has a glass back, which means it can be charged wirelessly, but it also means you can break it easily. I got a simple transparent back cover with a raised bezel around the edges. It cost about 9 dollars, came in the same day as the phone.I would recommend this phone and the Amazon Renewed Premium program. Yes the cost of the phone was more than it would have been with renewed only, but being able to return the phone for up to a year is worth it.

The phone (refurbished) seems to be working fine.  It’s only been a few weeks but so far so good.  My only issue was I ordered a 256 & received a 128 mb.  I have the two TB in the cloud but you still can’t really do as much once ur phone or tablet is full so this was important to me but the company offered me a full refund if I wanted to ship back or a partial refund to keep the latter.  I opted for that because I didn’t feel like waiting and setting everything up again. They issued me the partial refund I selected within hours.  No 5-7 business days nonsense so I’d recommend this company Joygoods and their commitment to responsiveness if shopping for a refurbished iPhone or the like. The model doesn’t come with face recognition but the home button works for fingerprint print unlike many refurbs (particularly in this price range) so yeah they were solid.  The battery health was also at 93% which is stellar for a refurbished phone. 👊🏼❤️👍

Received and opened. Had a roughed and scratch portion on the top right side of the screen, so much so that the screen protector didn’t adhere to this part of the screen. Noticeable as a bubble on the screen. I’m pretty sure I bought the premium one promising, little to no cosmetic damage. Bought it for my friend who needed to replace her phone. She needed a phone more than the time it takes to return and receive a replacement so she said “it’s fine.”, but I’m a little bit disappointed.

I was a little hesitant about purchasing a renewed phone and expecting to receive an iPhone SE (2020) that had some visible scratches on the screen and case. The phone I received looked like it was brand new!  I was truly amazed how easy it was to upload my old iPhone 6 information to it. Needless to say, I am very, very happy with this purchase and all the money I saved purchasing renewed versus new.

I am happy but it has the minimum battery life listed which is what they stated could happen… Different buying options have different battery life ranges and I got the lowest end of my range but it is okay! The biggest sad thin is that the SIM card port was broke by whoever fixed it or had it last. The port is functional but it is broke. There will be small defects but for the price I am privledged.

NOTE: I purchased this as a ""renewed"" product by Amazon. I've mostly purchased renewed phones off of eBay, but I've burned before by waiting a week or two, giving a positive review, then the item crapping out on me soon after so I thought I'd give Amazon's refurbished product a try since you have 90 days of guaranteed satisfaction and you can always come back to edit your reviews.MY ISSUES THUS FAR (3 days into ownership): Essentially, the phone is *not* fully functional.1. I'm already dealing with multiple app crashes. I'd like to blame it on the app alone, but the last refurbished iphone SE (original) that I owned started doing this with a single app which progressed into multiple apps crashing on me. That phone has only lasted a few months. Now, I'm not entirely sure if this is a refurbished phone issue or an iphone SE issue, but I know that the new iphone SE I originally purchased directly from the store didn't do this to me until the end of it's lifespan.2. Rings are not reliably coming through which has already resulted in a couple of missed calls. I work from home so I cannot be missing these calls from my office. Sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't. I've checked all of my settings (even the silent mode), and I cannot figure out why only a portion of my incoming calls actually ring.THE POSITIVES: The refurbished guarantee has held true in some regard. I have 82% battery health (renewed guarantees 80% or more) and it does seem to retain it's charge very well. The cosmetic blemishes are at a minimum, and I would say that it is in excellent condition insofar as looks are concerned....I just cannot get past the fact that this phone already has software issues mere days into ownership. I may have to deduct another star and/or exchange this item for one that works properly.

I originally had the iPhone SE 2nd Generation but dropped it one too many times. Bought this as a replacement because I like small phones and this is the smallest out of all the iPhones on the market. I bought the excellent condition iPhone and it brand new. No scratches on screen or anywhere else. Came with charger and instructions on what to do so that you don’t mess up your SIM card. All I had to do was put my SIM card in and power on the phone and it worked perfectly. I give this seller 5 stars because it’s like brand new and it’s unlocked so I can use any service provider.

I’m a college student and my phone screen went black on me a couple weeks ago, so I was kind of screwed without a phone and my data, but this one arrived within a few days (it was half a day late but overnight since it was set to arrive 8PM- wasn’t a huge deal) and it works perfectly. I was able to get all my data transferred through iCloud and it’s just like my old phone. I believe it came with a screen protector seeing as the screen looks raised which is nice. There are a couple tiny tiny scratches on the protector but that’s to be expected with the refurbished phones, that would be the only flaw I see. Battery seems even better than my old phone and I was worried about maximum charge/capacity only being around 80% but it hasn’t been an issue at all!

I honestly only bought this phone because I trust amazon's return policy, so my expectations were pretty low. I saw reviews that the max capacity for battery life can range, well I lucked out, mine is 100%. At first, my battery stopped at 80% because I kept getting notifications that there was suddenly water in the charging port. Well found out there is a way to completely bypass this and then my battery never gave me an issue again. There was a small chip on the screen, but that was expected and my screen protector hides it pretty well. Other than that, I have no issues, it seemed pretty brand new to me. This was a pretty good purchase.

So my son wanted a new phone. But as a single father of 3 boys with no child support I as a dad can’t afford to buy him a brand new phone. So he saved up $300. He wanted this so I ordered it. When I tell you it looks brand new!!!! So far it’s perfect! It it keeps up I don’t see me even buying myself a new phone and being stuck with a payment! I’ll plan on an Amazon renewed! And no, they didn’t pay me to write this review lol. This phone so far, is amazing. It’s only been 4 days. I’ll update the review if I end up having any unnecessary issues.

I ordered a Red iphone 11 but I got a black one instead, I was sad, but the seller was really great and we sorted this problem out in my best interest. Battery life is great I can use this for two days without charging with heavy uses. Even though battery health came at 78%. Scraches on the back and screen but nothing a case and screen protector could not hide, although few scratches are visable where screen protector could not cover. Overall I love the device.

This is the second time I buy a refurbished phone from Amazon. The first one is still working after several years but it doesn't have enough memory (32 GB), that is why I am upgrading it.So far with the second phone, so good, as advertised. (Be careful with your color selection. ""Yellow"" means bright yellow, not ""gold"". So just be careful). I will keep you posted in case something unexpected goes wrong.

First iphone (a Five)  I bought from this vendor, lasted years, until it was outdated.Second iphone (11)  was defective, vendor promptly issued a full refund.  I bought my third iphone 11 from the SAME VENDOR, it was excellent!  When I need another phone, I will look up this vendor!

 Update: the seller contacted me later the following day after reaching out to them and apologized and is going to replace it. It could have just been an oversight so I’ll give it a go.Original: This was advertised as excellent condition and probably should have been categorized as good condition. The screen and back glass are both scratched and dinged up so much that it glitters in the light.The shipping was super fast, it came packaged well, and the price was decent. It seems to work perfectly otherwise, but dings in the screen can definitely affect the overall strength and make it less durable. This is for my 15 year old son so durability is a must.I sent a message to the seller yesterday but haven’t heard back yet. It hasn’t been 48 hours for a response, not faulting them for that, but I may just return it. It seems either they didn’t review it well before re-selling it, or they didn’t think the damaged glass was a quality issue. I’m not completely sure I want a replacement from them, but if they end up reaching out before I return it Monday, I will update.

Upgraded from an iPhone 7. Well-packaged. Clear instruction. Transferred via iCloud in 8 minutes. NO MORE physical SIM cards!!!It came with a perfectly installed screen protector, which is nice. Me putting one on, always ended up crooked.Zero flaws and honestly appears brand new.

Phone looks great for the price. Only disclaimer is read the comments I got the excellent condition and the screen more then likely was replaced due to glue still around the outside with fuz on it and light wear around the edges. Doesn’t come with Apple box or a Apple brand charger. Overall I’m satisfied with the price and look just be aware of what your getting.

Very happy with this purchase. This phone almost looks brand new. Had it came in an Apple box, I wouldn’t be able to tell that this phone was refurbished. It has a SIM card tray on the side and since I use a carrier for cheaper data and no contract it was extremely easy to pop out the SIM card tray and place my SIM card in and I was good to go. Also very easy to transfer my old iPhone to this one (you just hold the phone next to the new one, it’s that simple!)

My phone took a swim over the weekend, and I needed a replacement within 2 days before leaving on a month long trip. All new iPhone 13 and 14 pros are sold out due to it being near Christmas, so I was left with no choice but to buy a refurb on Amazon. I’m glad I did! Saved a few hundred bucks, and it’s good as new. 0 scratches, 0 imperfections, battery health is at 98%. Highly recommend.

I bought this phone for work related use. I opted to go the refurbished route given my use case. After looking through my many options and deciding IOS is best for my business use I went ahead and pulled the trigger on this amazon refurbished Iphone XS. I knew what I was going into and fully expected this phone to have some minor blemishes and at least 80% battery.Upon arrival, I was satisfied with the phone despite the phone having much more extensive screen wear than expected AND a pretty poor excuse for a screen protector meant to cover up the screen wear. It is however an old model, refurbished phone, so that is to be expected.Here is the massive flub. The battery capacity.Upon receiving the iphone I promptly turned it on and tested the device, including the battery life. 91%. Given they guarantee 80% I thought I got really lucky and hit the refurbished jackpot.Well, fast forward not even a week and I decided to check the battery life again. 82%????Now I am no engineer, but 9% battery degradation in less than a week sounds excessive.I figured its still above 80%(what was advertised) so I still got the product I payed for. I can live with a shorter battery life.Fast forward 7 more months of minimal use. The phone is on daily with very limited screen time. Work related texts and calls. Occasionally audible, or spotify use.  Monitored all my charging to prevent over charging.Now my battery health is at 60%.Im not sure what rate of degradation is normal but given my use case mine seems to have died unreasonably quickly. I bought this as a cheaper alternative to a new iphone but 300 is by no means cheap and for a device that is quickly dying 8 months later.I am always a bit nervous buying refurbished tech, especially from Amazon.Buying refurbished is a flip of a coin and you may get luckier than me but this left a sour taste in my mouth and left me feeling inclined to leave this review as a disclaimer.In the future I will either buy new, or go the ebay refurbished route given their refurbs tend to be a bit cheaper and come with a 1 year warranty on all ebay certified refurbished tech.Good luck to all those in the market. If you decide to go this route, I hope you get luckier than I did.

Bought this from MOBILESUPPLY. I purchased the 'good' quality and was more than happy. Yes, the phone has some scratches on the sides, but that is to be expected from a 'good' quality 5 year old phone. It will be going in a case anyways. Back glass/cameras and front screen are in perfect condition. Face ID works great and the transfer process from my old phone was smooth. Battery health was at 85%, which is again 'good' for a 5 year old phone. I can vouch for MOBILESUPPLY if you can purchase from them.

We did eventually get the phone to work.  And now that the phone is more than an expensive calculator/paperweight he loves it.  The battery life is currently 93%  He loves the facial recognition though the mask wearing is a bit of a pain.  Otherwise the phone appears flawless and is safely nested in its new Defender case.

Great battery life, non scratches and even on the sides. Dual Sim Card, 5G and everything i was looking for, better for me since Apple removed the Sim Slot from their new phone and i14 doesn’t have that many new features. i14 feels more like an updated i13 anyways.

These are great phones for the kids, I still have one of these as my backup. The only downside is no 5G, so reception and data speeds can vary depending on location. You can request unlock with active service after 60 days, then phone can be used with ANY carrier. This phone does NOT have Total by Verizon/Tracfone software (so nothing like that appears when you power the phone on).

The phone came very carefully packaged and looked basically brand new. Not even a scratch was on it. It comes with a charger which you’re better off tossing away for emergencies only because it’s honestly kind of cheap. Get yourself a good charger from Amazon or use your old iPhone charger if you have one. The only negative was the battery capacity. The phone was showing 89% max capacity. Some people choose to return and exchange the phone because of that. I personally don’t care. I purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 12 Pro Max that got destroyed. I purchased that phone new from Apple and by the time it broke, it too only had 85% max capacity so no harm no foul as far as I’m concerned. If you do want to exchange, from what I’ve read, the process seems pretty seamless.I highly recommend this Amazon service if you want a phone at a more affordable option.

So this is my first experience with Amazon's renewed premium program where you pay between $50-$100 more than the renewed price but for that you get an item whose battery is at least at 90% capacity relative to a new one and instead of a 90 day warranty you get a year warranty and a year to return the item. For less than $100 I thought that was definitely worth it. However the first iPhone 12 pro they sent me had a battery that was at 85% capacity which really pissed me off because I felt cheated so I returned it and purchased it again and I'm glad I did because the 2nd ones battery was at 100% capacity and for all intents and purposes it was a brand new phone at a used price. Granted it's still really expensive it was $900 before tax but I got this to be future proof at least for the next several years. This is my first iPhone before I was all android phones but it seemed like every year I was having to buy another phone because something out of my control always happened but my parents still had their iPhone 8 that they bought new and it was still working perfectly. I haven't had this phone for more than a few days but so far I'm very impressed with it. The facial recognition capabilities are so good. My phone can recognize me when I'm in a dark room whereas my Samsung tablet can't recognize my face without all the lights on. One feature this phone doesn't have that really surprised me was that there is no built in fingerprint scanner and I think that was a mistake on apple's part. The battery is supposed to only last 21 hours but a full charge is lasting me a little over 2 days. The screen is gorgeous is it HDR Dolby Vision and HLG compatible and not even my 4k tv supports all of those so it makes streaming look brilliant. You can see every detail even though the screen is 6.7inches. it seems like everyday I'm finding out a new function that this phone has granted a lot them I'll never use because I don't use my phone that way but it's cool to know that if I wanted to I could if I so choosed. I guess I'll stop my review here because you get the gist and I hate it when people on Amazon beat a dead horse and I don't want to be one of those so Amazon renewed premium is a worthwhile program and the iPhone 12 pro max is an awesome phone that's worth the investment.

Was a bit skeptical purchasing a refurbished item, as I have had problems in the past. Since I needed a larger sized phone, due to visual impairment, I opted to try a refurbed product again and kept my fingers crossed that it wouldn't disappoint. I am so very happy that I gave it another try. The ipnone 12 pro max showed up in a structurally sound package, looked brand new, and had an excellent battery percentage at 97%. My only complaint is that even though for listening to music and watching videos the sound is excellent, for notifications and incoming call notification, the volume is extremely low, even though in settings everything is set correctly and sound is set to max. Other than that, I am a very happy customer.

I purchased this phone in early 2021. It’s been almost two years & I'm still impressed with this phone. This was an incredible value & an amazing upgrade. It hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. A full charge still lasts me all day. The camera quality is excellent & takes crisp videos.The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is the audio. My wife also has an 11 Pro Max that we bought direct from Apple & when playing videos, the audio comes out of the speaker at the bottom & the speaker at the earpiece. Mine only comes out the bottom & it’s much quieter than hers. It works fine for phone calls, but doesn’t kick in when playing videos.Still, for the price I paid, I’m very happy with this phone.

The phone itself was in pretty decent condition but not as I ordered it. There was some scratches on the top part of the screen and the battery life was pretty poor. Gotta sink more money into that now, as if paying a couple hundred bucks for a like new phone wasn’t enough. The camera isn’t as good as it should be for the condition I bought the in. I feel the phone itself wasn’t worth the price I paid for it and also that the price offered was ridiculously too high for the product I received.

I was very surprised when I received this phone. It honestly looked new. I carefully examined it and there were no marked on the sides or back and even the screen had no scratches even the little tiny micro scratches phones develop in normal use. Also battery life is amazing, so I am honestly thinking this was a new phone.Now on to the specs, I purchased this phone in 2022. It is still very fast. It does not have 5g but I have not seen any issues yet. I did some reading and found new iPhones use LTE most of the time to save battery life but leave it listed as 5g on the screen.Lastly I do miss MagSafe, but am glad it does have wireless charging. The cameras still take very good pictures. For less than half the cost of a new iPhone you honestly can’t go wrong

Quick Note: The test report screenshot shows three failed items. That's only due to me not having headphones to test at the time as well as the SIM card. I've a screenshot of speed test working on T-Mobile network LTE. So it works fine.Initially I ordered an iPhone 11 Pro Max for my mother, 64GB version. Unfortunately, the ear piece wasn't working and contacted the seller via Amazon message center. I had to send the phone back in order to complete the replacement.They provided the  2-day shipping label (sent out on Saturday, arrived there Monday). They kept in pretty close contact with me and that was good. They shipped Tuesday and received Thursday morning. So there's very little delay in getting the replacement.Diagnostics checked out (see screenshots). The Earpiece tests that failed were due to me not having a headphone to try it on at the time. But I'm assuming it works and will edit if that changes.The condition of the phone is near new! No blemishes on the body and screen looks really clean. There was very minute permanent lines in the screen that looked like smudges, but they with the sceen on, you don't notice it at all. PLUS they gave us a couple acrylic screen protectors, so that was a major plus!The BONUS (at least for me)!It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me, because they ended up upgrading me to the 256GB model free (initially 64GB model). My mom didn't understand what that meant, and I pretty much explained that she can download apps and take photos to her hearts desire LOL.It's a phone for mom, and she's coming from a Samsung A21 phone that had performance issues and wifi problems. Kept saying there's no internet and reboots in safemode. I wanted simplicity with Face-ID (which also works) that pretty much takes care of itself, and iOS delivers on that.So ya, experienced issues. All devices will have a defect one way or the other (or none). You just need to contact their support and work with them before submitting your review. It annoys me when someone says ""It's defective"" with no resolution comments of what they ended up doing.If I need another replacement phone, I'll definitely do business with them again.
