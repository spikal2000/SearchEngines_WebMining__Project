"        Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, 128GB, Sierra Blue - Unlocked (Renewed)       ","
I was a bit worried when I saw the 1 star reviews for the conditions that the phone came in but the one I received was like brand new! It was a little bit dirty (this thing is a fingerprint magnet so I don‚Äôt blame them), I don‚Äôt see any scratches or dings. The overall battery health was 100% which is awesome, for $890 this was a great deal. I bought this phone as an xmas gift and I haven‚Äôt activated it yet so hopefully that will work out as well. Overall, I love it so far, I‚Äôm gonna clean it and put it back in the box and wrap it for xmas! üéÖ

I haven‚Äôt used an IPhone for long time and I do like this one. However I can‚Äôt lie when I say there‚Äôs so many features that I miss on androids. Of course there‚Äôs unique features with this IPhone I very much appreciate. The battery life is great so far and I love that I can see the battery percentage of my Bluetooth ear buds. However, I‚Äôm VERY disappointed with the charger this phone comes with. 1 week of use and the charger was already refusing to charge my phone. Had mornings where my phone didn‚Äôt charge at all overnight and it was frustrating having to go to work with low battery. I had no choice but to buy my own separate lightning charger which works completely fine after 1 month of use. Overall good phone and works like new.

I could write so much, but it all boils down to apple IOS being about 5-7 years behind developement of android.  The ability to customize something as basic as the keyboard (to the effective degree you can in android) is frustratingly absent, and you are stuck with the most basic of keyboards that require you to have to flip through different keyboard screens just to get to common things like a questionmark.Phone specific, the cameras and what not are good, but the screen colors are a tad washed out/pale, and there really isn't a fix for it.All and all, my next phone won't be an iphone, apple IOS is just too archaic and undeveloped compared to android, but the phone is decent enough that I'll hang on to it for a year or so before upgrading, which is something I don't usually do, given my last phone was a Note 9 that I used for 4 years.  Wanting to upgrade after a year is what happens when apple's flagship phone is crippled by a severely lacking operating system...

Me gusto que no lo dejaran en la puerta de mi casa, porque no estaba en el momento de la entrega,  lo enviaron a una farmacia que recibe paquetes y me dejaron una nota para recogerlo.  Cuando abr√≠ el paquete estaba en una caja que no es la original pero es muy similar, vino con su cargador y cable. El tel√©fono en excelente estado, como nuevo. Ahora me falta usarlo y probar si funciona bien su sistema operativo.

Estaba tan emocionada de recibir el iPhone y cuando lo abr√≠ la verdad me decepcione un poco por qu√© no ven√≠a en su caja original era s√≥lo blanca y por la cantidad que se paga uno espera que venga con todos los accesorios, tambi√©n mandaron un cargador ese es punto a su favor!El celular ven√≠a sin rayones la pantalla muy bien  me encanto, lo malo en la parte de las c√°maras ven√≠a un poco sucio tra√≠a como polvo lo limpi√© y quedo perfecto!. Pens√© en regresarlo pero la verdad me encanto y el celular funciona muy bien.Yo creo que comprar el linea lleva sus riesgos de que te lleguen las cosas mal, tal vez sea mejor comprar en la tienda apple. Le di 3 estrellas por que me llego un poco sucio y sin la caja original fuera de eso el cel estaba perfecto!.A los que venden el producto por favor l√≠mpienlos antes de mandarlos!! Pagamos mucho y esperamos recibir todo bien. Gracias!üòä

Phone arrived and I spent hours setting it up. Had to make a trip to Verizon because the SIM card wouldn‚Äôt work. They tell me to contact apple. Apple tells me through remote diagnostics that it has multiple hardware issues and is defective to the point it is unusable. Now I have to print this label, package it, take it to UPS, wait on them to receive it to issue a refund, and wait on the refund to process. Total waste of my time and I won‚Äôt be able to get another phone for however long it takes to do all the return process.

Frankly, I don't care enough to return the phone and I already put a screen protector on, but yeah there is some minor cosmetic damage such as; scratches on the back and the front, as well as some minor damage on the bottom right corner of the edge where it was probably dropped in the past.

I bought this iPhone 13 for my wife and it supposed to be in an excellent condition because that's what I paid for but instead when the phone arrived, the body of the phone were bented back and curving. It doesn't feel good when holding and it won't fit in the case as good because the body of the phone was not even or flat but bent.

Es una l√°stima que no pueda usar el celular ya que el anuncio dec√≠a que era completamente desbloqueado y cuando lleg√≥ a mi pa√≠s, la tarjeta SIM no funciona con el iPhone.Anteriormente compr√© otros celulares de Amazon y nunca tuve ese problema, pero esta vez fue muy inconveniente ya me encuentro en el extranjero y es complicado encontrar una soluci√≥n estando lejos del vendedor

Worst phone experience ever. There is zero customer service if you beed to switch carriers via Amazon. Nobody will help.

It is a refurbished device, yes. But it's still great!. I've had it for two months now, didn't come with any scratches, hasn't had any weird glitch, and has responded great to all the stuff i download it there ! (getting a 128gb iPhone for less than $900 sounds like a fair deal knowing how over priced iphones are lol). The only thing is that the charger wasn't the original one but hey at least it brought a charger and a phone in perfect condition! It is also unlocked and i will finish it paying in December (I got it with klarna), which I feel it's fair compared to the iPhone 11 i got from at&t in 2019 and finished paying in December 2021 with the monthly payments being $150 lol.

Very happy with this purchase. This phone almost looks brand new. Had it came in an Apple box, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell that this phone was refurbished. It has a SIM card tray on the side and since I use a carrier for cheaper data and no contract it was extremely easy to pop out the SIM card tray and place my SIM card in and I was good to go. Also very easy to transfer my old iPhone to this one (you just hold the phone next to the new one, it‚Äôs that simple!)

I have had this phone for eight months and it has totally failed.  I took it to Apple and was told that these phones all had defective batteries.  But that was not the worst of it:  Last week, I was unable to send or receive text messages or call. It would not connect to wifi.  They offered me a trade in of $385.00  What large international company does not stand behind their products?  No one. Apple told me that they do not manufacture these phones but rather, they buy from a middle-man. And they are made in China.  I have to go back to Apple in a week to figure out what to do.  I am not buying another product from them. I will give my $385.00 credit to whoever is standing next to me. Once you are their customer, they have you for life.

Some people just don't take the time to carefully read the directions. IMO... That is why this phone has so many needlesly bad reviews. GRANTED... To use a circus metaphor, I had to jump through several hoops just to make this phone & the wireless plan work to my satisfaction. HOWEVER...! I have a few factors to point out. 1) I am a techno-geek so I am very comfortable with setting up all sorts of ectronic devices. 2) I already owned a fire tablet witch made the setup of this Iphone so much easier. I even already have a wifi system that I personally set up to connect all the internet devices in my home. So, with the tablet on hand, it was easy to got back & forth with all the signup data to get the Iphone up & running. 3) I live on a remote farm on the edge of nowhere so only the best & most modern phone would be able to get a signal out here, not to neglect the metion of my home having a metal roof & this phone can still get one bar & sometimes even two but as I said, I have wifi & the setup on this allows for internet calling if the cell reception is too weak to get a signal. Adding to that, this phone pairs well with my amazon smart watch but it was admttedly a little difficult to get it to work correctly. Although... SERIOUSLY...? If everyone just took thier time to carefully go through all the steps, the effort really is worth your time because this phone can do so much more than metioned in the product description. I, myself, have yet to tap onto its full potetial since I ha eonly had it for two days. The battery life span on a single charge seems slightly superior to any other phone or tablet. I certainly seems to hold a much longer charge although it also seems to take a little longer to charge. The graphics are really awesome & the camera clarity of the screen even when your suject moves just enough to blur the image on any other phone or digital camera, is really superior overall. However, the sound, although crystal clear, at max volume, it is a little weak. So I am looking into getting a mini BT cube to suplement the max volume but one of my BT headphones will work fine for now. Siri, the AI that comes with the phone, can't seem to compete with my Alexa based AI. I am thinking that if the two were pitted against each other, IMO, Alexa would win but only by a slim margin since the AI techknowledgy for both still needs a lot more work before it can be seen as reliable enough. There are a lot of other factors to talk about but as I have already mentioned, I only had n'my phone for two days so an update may be forthcoming a few months from now. Lastly, IMO a lot of apps were already preloaded into this phone but many really weren't worth the effort to use them. The mapping & builtin compass were really nice because the app also included map coordinates & the current geographical elevation which, I felt to be a very useful feature. Other than that &, I may have more to offer later after I play with my new toy for another month or so... more later...

I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT  ) this is very important detail, it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!.  I will also say their after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important.  Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business,  I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation,  Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone,  is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However,  for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with  90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and  as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice  addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors,  I will say as they are sufficient,  I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so  my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending  that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience.  I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation,  Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty,  and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!

I got mines for a good price around $385. No scratches on the front screen nor the back or the sides. Battery life is good the only side effect I found was that it heats up pretty fast. Every app works perfectly fine. If you are looking for a bigger size phone I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the iPhone 11 Pro but I would recommend the iPhone pro MAX just a few dollars more wouldn‚Äôt hurt for a good value. It came with a charger and a USB cube but I would also recommend to get a legit apple cord and usb cube to charge the phone. Please read the instructions when you buy this phone, the cheaper ones are the ones that are a little big damaged and the higher prices are the ones that aren‚Äôt.Over all I give it 5 stars because it works as great as my iPhone 12 :)

It‚Äôs way better to get Amazon renewed compared to any old joe of a company selling it but they still don‚Äôt go by everything they promise. I ordered this and it has scratches on the camera lens and it‚Äôs banged up, but other than that the whole exterior is great. The only problem is they boast a 90% battery health or above for AR but mine came at 85%. Not a super big deal to me but if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre concerned about then make sure you know what you‚Äôre getting into.

Phone works great...But calls & songs were muffled through the speakers...I cleaned them all myself using a hack from youtube and now it's working great...I just wish they had be cleaned before I received the phone...To me a refurbished phone should also be a clean phone...I didn't find this problem till the phone was all set up and I had made/received a phone call...Thankfully there was a simple fix and it wasn't more complicated...5 stars for the phone and 4 stars for having to do the work myself.

I switched from a iPhone SE to iPhone 11 pro. I bought this iPhone in a rush because who can live without their phone. Phone works great, and all the features work well. No scratches on the device and set up was like new. Exactly what I expected, if hesitant just buy, you will not regret it.Battery percentage was 80 percent capacity when received, which is kinda low, but charger stays charged longer than my last phone.

Phone gets too warm when switched on and seems to use up the battery over a period of about 12 hours with minimal use. I take it that after a few charge up operations, this should normalize. Other than that, it works very well with a clear display and reliable functionality. The Otter Box protects the phone magnificently. I am generally pleased with the phone and there is no sign that it was ever used even for a day. Thank you for your reliable product.

When I ordered they said that the excellent condition was supposed to be at least 90% but it is 82% which is low having in mind that any phone with a battery life below 80% the battery is going away really fast and 82% percent is not really far from that/

Sabemos que cuesta mucho creer cuando hay tanta y tantas opiniones diversas. Pero a las pruebas me remito. Mi iPhone 11 Pro lleg√≥ con 97% de condici√≥n de Bater√≠a. En √≥ptimas condiciones, sin rayas en la pantalla ni en los laterales brillantes. Todo funciona perfectamente ¬°Ah y hasta con protector de pantalla lleg√≥! La caja blanca gen√©rica en la que vino era un poco endeble, pero el tel√©fono estaba bien protegido por dentro. Cargador y cable gen√©rico, pero hay que entender que es un equipo refurbished.

At first I was going to return it cause it was smaller than the 11 but after putting my case on and accepting it I Decided to keep it, it works just like new and I was originally trying to get my services through boost mobile as I was a customer with them for years but this phone was not compatible with boost so I went to metro and everything pretty much went smooth. No scratches , dents or anything wrong with the sound it works just like new. For half of the price

If you thinking about making a purchase this seller I would recommend, ordered my phone and received it in 2 days, when opening the box the phone came with a power cable and charging block the phone looked brand new with only 1 small scratch on the left corner. Other than that everything works 100% phone was completely unlocked no issues getting service through a provider, I‚Äôm glad I made this purchase saved me over $500 I would highly recommend this seller.Notes: battery health 90%, with tiny corner scratch and came with a screen protector already installed.5 star product, very fast shipping, safe buy

I ordered the phone in March. It arrived in decent condition; the audio was always a little wonky but it was passable.  Last week, the phone just died and would not turn on.  It‚Äôs still dead and I ended up purchasing a new phone. Moral of the story; purchase some type of extended warrant coverage. I contacted the seller on here and was told they have a 90 day guarantee and since it‚Äôs been more than 90 days there‚Äôs nothing they can do.

My phone came in perfect condition. No scratches or nicks at all. The battery is at 93% health which is alright with me. This is a big jump for me from iPhone 6s to 11 Pro.The display is really nice and the face recognition is a great feature. It was easy to switch sims and transfer data over. I opted to go for renewed premium because of the year long replacement/warranty and the better quality of the phone. The premium was a pricey jump but who knows what could happen to a used phone within a year so I think it‚Äôs worth it.Altogether it is right in the middle of expensive and affordable. The phone has been working near identical to a brand new 11 Pro and I‚Äôve been very happy with this purchase.

The phone itself is great. No obvious scratches, speakers look clean, camera works great, etc. I‚Äôve had no issues with the phone, and I think it‚Äôs a great value for the money. That being said, phones under this condition are supposed to have battery health above 90% and this one came to me at 89%. Not a huge deal except that they did say that it would be above 90 and it wasn‚Äôt. That being said, the battery lasts me easily all day and can even get me through two days depending on my usage. Overall, great phone. No regrets

Purchased an iPhone 11 Pro 256 gb Renewed Premium. Item was in a like new condition. Physically as was described. Was very very disappointed though when I checked the battery health and found that it was 88% and not the 90+% as stated for Renewed Premium phones. Contacted Amazon and was given a discount. Still love doing business with them‚Ä¶Facial recognition is quick, battery life is left to question‚Ä¶Maybe need to tweak settings. Overall good value. Just need to give customers what is advertised.

Despite all the negative reviews I saw on amazon my product arrived a week late but it was as advertised it had a brand new Apple certified battery minimal scratches on the phone and everything was in good working order. Definitely worth it if you are looking to get an iPhone 11 pro but don't want to pay the price for a new one,and I would recommend it over the iPhone 12 pro just because of the better battery and the fact that 5G is not available in most areas especially the ultra wide band high speed one so if you can live without the 5G this is definitely the phone to pick up, and the cameras are absolutely amazing I was blown away with how well they performed in the dark, these are the best iPhone cameras I've seen yet, I would like to compare them to a pixel at some point but make no mistake this is an amazing camera. As a photographer I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to take good pictures with as little hassle it's not a replacement for a DSLR camera but it's a great camera to have in your pocket and to shoot on the spot.

I was really nervous and skeptical about ordering such an expensive item online. But i was not disappointed at all. The phone arrived in only 3 days! The phone was neatly and securely packaged. I seen some peoples reviews state that this company lies and these phones are not new and they have scratches etc. THEY ARE REFURBISHED - which means they have been used, and so some amount of scratching/dings should be expected. With that being said, there is only one very light scratch on the phone i received and can only be noticed if you are really looking for it. It is unlocked for all carriers as it states. It does not come with a sim card! YOU HAVE TO BUY A SIM CARD FROM THE PROVIDER YOU WANT TO USE. This isnt a big deal at all, i was able to purchase one from my provide (Boost Mobile) for $10.00 - i mention this only so that if you plan to buy this phone, buy a sim card from your provider at the same time, so you dont have any delays when you try to activate the phone.In conclusion - definitely worth the money and I'm so happy i went ahead and bought this phone!

This was from the ""Amazon Renewed Store"" but is actually shipped by a company called TechExchange in Brooklyn NY. The phone comes in a pretty unimpressive generic box. The phone had some plastic sheet sticker over it and came with a cheap aftermarket ""Shark brand"" charging adapter and Shark lighting cable.The phone itself was in EXCELLENT condition! There were some dust on the corners of the camera bump but that was easily cleaned. Finally, there was a bit of slight scratches on the metal border. Totally reasonable for a used phone, especially since I will be putting it in a case anyways! Finally the battery was a whopping 94% health! The listing guaranteed 80% battery health so 94% was far better than I expected! The battery life is the true indicator of the age of the phone which means it was very lightly used. Obviously your mileage will vary but I would not hesitate to buy this again in the future. If it's a bad condition phone, just return and rebuy!

It made me nervous to buy such an expensive ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù item, so I‚Äôm happy to report this looks like a brand new phone - not a single scratch or any sign of having been used. The only complaint I have (which is with Apple not the seller nor Amazon) is that the battery health is only 84%. For an iPhone 11 that seems like quite a deterioration. My iPhone 7 was at 84% when I replaced it with this.  It does seem to lose battery life faster than I thought it would.All the apps I use uploaded fine, no problem with the software update. Bluetooth connection worked, connected to WiFi.A generic charging wire and block were included and the phone was totally unlocked and ready for me to link to my prepaid provider. I‚Äôve only just gotten this phone so I will update if it breaks down or has issues. So far, so good.  I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!

Upon receiving this phone, I was glad that I didn‚Äôt see any scratches or marks in the screen or the back. But the anti-dust mesh next to front microphone gave away the secret. It seemed badly aligned and the color of the mesh wasn‚Äôt even uniform throughout. It is small but my eyes caught it quick!

I was pleasantly surprised when my new (to me) iPhone 11 Pro arrived.  It was in perfect condition & I could not find one flaw on any of the surfaces.  I set my old iPhone 6S next to it and all the information transferred seamlessly, removed the SIM card from the old phone and inserted it in the new phone and was up and running in 15 minutes.  It has been one week since this and the phone works like new except the battery health is 86% but, it is a used phone and I am OK with that.  I will replace the battery at some time in the future.  The camera in this phone is light years ahead of my iPhone 6S and I might just stop carrying my point-and-shoot cameras for most situations.  I would definitely purchase another phone from this seller in the future based on this experience.

The only defect I was able to find was a little scratch on the screen (which I hate but with the screen protector you can't see it anymore, and they said that ""there are no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm's length"" so that was true), apart from that looks absolutely perfect. The battery came in 89% (not bad but not perfect), the description of the product says that I would come over 80% so they kept their word in that as well. I have been using it for a couple of days and everything works perfectly.I genuinely believe this was a good purchase.I suggest you to pay attention to the descriptions of the product, they explain the characteristics of the phone, the accessories and the box you are receiving and they do keep the promise.If you don't agree with the characteristics they are promising, just don't buy.

Firewire would not insert easily. So we put under a magnifying glass and noticed some cr..p in there. Along with white paint overspray. Obviously from 'renewing' the white phone. It did arrive on time and was packaged nicely with a 2 port usb charger and shorter firewire cord. The usb block sparked as I put it in the wall outlet. We did not attempt to use that. Used our old apple cord once the junk was removed from the port. Would not take a charge. Sent back immediately for refund. Will make one more attempt at a renewed phone from amazon. But not buying from BuySPRY ever again. Had we looked closer we'd have noticed their horrible ratings.

I don't buy the latest and greatest - over three years ago, I bought my 1st cell phone (work gave me a 5s), and was sticker-shocked by the cost of an apple-certified 16Gb 6s for $300. So naturally, I made it last as long as I could. My battery is now at 70% health, and dies quite quickly whenever I do anything that isn't texting or calling.Now that the 12s are out, I decided I would get the best last-model, and began searching for an 11 pro. After reading reviews of this seller, I was a little leery to get something that might have visible scratches on the screen, or have hardware/software issues - As you can see in the photos, I have no issues yet. The screen/body are unblemished, and so far, no fatal errors in use. If anything pops up, I will come back and comment.While I feel for the people who had issues with their referbished model arrive with errors, I would recommend it. Hey, if there's an issue, Amazon has a return policy!

It has no scuff marks, scratches, or anything. The sound quality of the pro and pro max (my wife has this one) is nowhere near that of the 11 itself, but that is an apple flaw.

I‚Äôve just received my order: an iPhone 11 pro, ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù, and was hoping I could leave a good review about the whole experience.However, I have to say I am very disappointed due to the conditions the cellphone came in - it seems it was poorly inspected. For being a ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù, I was expecting it to come in better physical conditions. As soon as I opened it, I realized it has some scratches in the camera frames, and the sticky plastic cover was dirty with hair, as though the cellphone had been unboxed many times. In addition, the battery health is 87%. I was expecting at least 90%, as the description says: ‚Äúat least 90% battery life‚Äù. I think I was sent only a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù and not a ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù.As a loyal Amazon customer, I request a proper solution for this problem.Please let me know if I need to provide further details. I did not find a way to contact the seller directly

The phone is in good shape and everything works, however the max battery life is already depleted to the point of it telling you it needs to be replaced. If the phone was ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù like it said that should have been taken care of‚Ä¶ other than that it‚Äôs a good phone.

I already had an iPhone 11 Pro 256 GB model that I bought the day it first came out at the Apple Store. I paid $1245 for that phone brand new, but I upgraded it to iOS 13.4.1 which made it incompatible with a game controller I‚Äôm using for streaming.For less than $980, I purchased a Renewed iPhone 11 Pro 512GB model from BuySpry which still has iOS 13.3.1 which works with my controller.So yeah I‚Äôm happy I got more storage capacity at a cheaper cost than my original phone. The screen looks great (no scratches / came with screen protector preinstalled) and the battery life is just as good as my original iPhone 11 Pro.The only caveats: (1) Doesn‚Äôt come with original box or accessories. (2) I can‚Äôt buy additional AppleCare coverage for this sweet device.Next time I upgrade I‚Äôll probably get a bigger screen model iPhone (the Pro Max model).Thank you!!!

Ordered two iPhone 11 Pros with 512gb memory. Two weeks in and phones are excellent. One came with 98% battery and one came with 85% battery. Each was near new. One had a screen crack that was perhaps 1mm, like someone poked it with a tack in the center. Both came with tempered glass protectors installed over the screens (probably coincidence). We are pleased

Saw the first review giving one star and there isn't enough reviews to form a solid decisive at first glance. So yeah, I hesitated a little especially when it's a $1k purchase .  With the iPhone presented as ""like new"" condition, I went with it knowing that Amazon got my back with the buyer protection program.Received the phone within a couple of days. Bam! Everything looked like new. Charging cable and EarPods looked untouched.  Phone came with the sticker covering the screen so I peeled it off. Turned on the phone - everything worked. Battery health check showed 100%.  Went to sprint store, got me a SIM card and activated this new iPhone.For some Apple enthusiasts, it may be a dealbreaker because this iPhone came with a generic phone box. To me, I don't give a ship as long as I get all the phone equipment.Anyway, I have this silver 512gb one for 2 weeks now. No complaints. Satisfied.

I debated for weeks before buying this IPhone, for fear of buying a dud, but, finally took everyone's advice and gave it a try.  I love it.  It's one of the best buys of my life.  It's battery is full 100%, I can find no problems with it and love being able to Facetime with family and friends around the world, it's like being with them for awhile.  I truly love this phone, it's so easy to learn and use and the battery is so long lived that I'm not constantly charging it.  Anyone debating trying a refurbished phone can use my advice and think about it positively.

My iPhone 8 died suddenly and with supply chain issues and back orders I would've had to wait for Verizon to get new phones to buy. In a pinch I ordered this and took a chance because it's not cheap. It arrived a day earlier, packaged nicely and at least 90 percent charged. I switched the sim cards and it's been a life saver ever since.

I used Android phone and needed to update my phone. Wife has iPhone x so decided to try iPhone 11 as well as Samsung Android phone.Not sure what is so special about the iPhone but the way it is architected is horrible. I want to own my data and not have it in the cloud. iPhone defaults to saving everything in their cloud so reconfigured that. Tried to search for a picture and there are no directories (I thought what kind of rubbish is this).Android is not the best OS but at leas it is architected like a real system. I will continue with an Android phone.Just to add, I have returned this item and Amazon received the item on a certain date. It is going to be a month in 5 days and still no refund by Amazon. I do not like that they are holding onto my money for so long. I do hope I get my refund or I will have to raise an issue with them.

¬†I bought this phone for nearly $700 and it was listed as ""new"", however it came in an after market box, with an after market charger that didn't even work. However, the real concerning problem is the minor issues I've had with the phone itself since getting it. Apps constantly crash, or completely won't even open (example shown in attachment, and unfortunately they will only let me post one video per review I have tons of examples of everything happening). The screen constantly glitches, sometimes with even a purple-ish pixelated color. Today the phone completely spazzed out and logged me out of every thing, including my Apple ID and deleted all of my messages, and will now not let me receive or make FaceTime calls. I've contacted Apple Suport and they just suggested I do a software update, but the phone will not let me download the update and neither space nor wifi is the issue. I also contacted the seller, but after reading the reviews and people saying the seller never got back with them I felt I should write a review as well, and I'm usually one to never do this. If you're thinking about buying a phone or anything else from this seller, I highly recommend that you DON'T. I was naive and assumed the issues would just eventually resolve itself, I also didn't want to admit I may've wasted nearly $700 on a dud, but they are gradually getting worse and worse, and I'll probably just have to suck it up and get a new phone or hope that GeekSquad or something can help resolve the issue.

I was skeptical about the product's relatively low cost, but the phone is fantastic! I received the color and carrier I wanted, and I'm very satisfied! However, the phone was at 10% battery when you turn it on, and the included charger looked old and a little dirty. Overall, there were only a few minor inconveniences, but it's still a great product nonetheless.

Have had for a few weeks now. Battery lasts two days almost. I did give 4 stars because I am overall satisfied but sometime my screen does freeze up. I have to lock phone then unlock and completely close app and reopen for it to work. Has became a little bit of a pain since I use my phone a lot for work. But everything else is good.

At first I was a little skeptical because of the comments I read, but overall one of my best purchases so far. There wasn‚Äôt a scratch on the lens, screen or anywhere on the phone which was my biggest fear. Also, the battery life was at 97% which I thought was great since most refurbished phones come at low  90‚Äôs %.  I‚Äôve been using this phone for a little over a week and so far so good. Great response time and no lag. I‚Äôll be back to give an update in a couple.

Setup was simple although it took a while to complete, phone was charged when I received it, setup easy cloning my old iPhone.

The product unfortunately did not come in the original box, but if you read the product description before buying you would know that they did mention some orders would come without that option. They did provide a charger though. For a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù Product this phone was delivered in great condition. There were no scratches nor cracks on my iPhone 11 Pro everything worked perfect from the camera options to just basic browsing. Battery came in at 100% health. Set up was simple. Face-ID works, definitely not a fake phone because the App Store is from APPLE where as fake phones take you to an android App Store and there are other ways you can tell a fake from an original apart.

I was so excited to finally get a new phone, I was looking forward to Midnight Green as it's one of my favorite colors.  I GOT SPACE GREY.  Yes.  Wrong Color.  Very disappointed.  I didn't want to hassle with an exchange or return so I decided to just deal with it.  It also said AT&T on the box even though I ordered for T-Mobile.The phone itself is in great shape, no scratches or marks on it.  It looks brand new even though it is renewed.  The Tech guy at the T-Mobile store was able to activate it and transfer all my stuff to it without any issues even though it said it is a AT&T phone.

Been using the 11 pro for the past week or since I've gotten it and everything works fine. Battery life is 97% and the only cosmetic defect I notice is a 1 cm long scratch near the bottom of the screen that is barely noticeable. It came with a screen protector already and a charger.So far I'm batting 2/2 on Amazon Renewed and I look to be buying more products from them in the future. Prime shipping + 3 month return window is just too good a combo, especially with how easy Prime returns are if you have a Kohls nearby.

This is my very first review ever. I was very skeptical about purchasing this device based on the mixed reviews. I want to say my phone is perfect looks brand new. I want to give it 5 stars. However, I am leaving only 4 due to the fact that the battery life is only 91%. I expected 95% or more.

I bought this product as a work phone. Outside the camera not being as I would have expected(I‚Äôm not writing a review based on that) the phone showed up with scratch marks on it which were highly visible. It had one small dent that was minuscule. The battery life from the get go was worse than my iPhone XR. Overall everything else works as expected. I feel it deserves a 3-4 star. If returning it wasn‚Äôt such a hassle I would have and spent the extra money for a brand new phone.

While there were no scratches or dings on the phone‚Äôs surface, there is definitely something wrong with the display. The colors have a bluish tone, and when turning the brightness down there are vertical lines all across the screen. That being said, 2 days in there have been no issues so far with phone functionality, battery life, camera, etc. I‚Äôm keeping it because I will probably be upgrading to the 13 anyway, but now that I‚Äôve noticed the display flaws they are really difficult to ignore. If you are visually picky, or just on your phone a lot, I would shop somewhere else.

I ordered green, I received the graphite color but I liked the color as well so I over looked that. Immediately, I noticed the speaker sounded blown out and very low. It‚Äôs only gotten worse. It sounds like my phone is under 20 blankets and coming from an Alien signal. I would return but I literally received this the day I was moving and I don‚Äôt know where I put the box. Next time I think I‚Äôll just spend the extra money at the apple store.

Was worried with the reviews but this phone is flawless, had it for almost a couple weeks now. Came with a screen protector already on it so that was a plus (Might not be included for all of them). Aside from the packaging, I could hardly tell it‚Äôs not brand new. Battery was at 98% efficiency. I might be a little biased since I went from the 7 to 11 pro, but this is an awesome phone.

Product is great. Seller BuySPRY didn't drop this item in the mail for 2 weeks. Amazon automatically sent me notifications titled 'your item may be lost'. The tracking number was created within 2 days of making the purchase, but only after I contacted the seller twice for a refund did they finally drop it off at a post office. (Yes, they sent by USPS...who still does that?)Product is great, as advertised, refurbed and not in original box, but I didn't buy the box, I bought the phone. Its genuine, and relatively flawless. 5 stars for product. 1 star for seller.

Phone arrived in perfect condition. However, I waited one week later to activate it only to find out that the product was defective. I called Amazon customer service whom transferred me to Apple for support. Once I talked to Apple they advised me that the product wasn't under warranty and they sent me to Apple store. When I arrived there they trouble shooted and told me the product was defective. Amazon had replaced/repaired the phone with a screen that wasn't backed by Apple which caused audio issues. Phone can only be used on speaker phone. Apple sent the phone out for repair and provided me with a loaner phone. Had to take my phone to my service provider and pay activation fee on loaner phone because it couldn't be done online since the phone was unable to receive sms notifications. Too much hassle for the money I paid to Amazon. Online nor Representative gave me the option to obtain a replacement phone for free. It's holiday season so the turn around time for repair will be longer. Item has unauthorized Apple parts causing audio issues. Took phone to Apple store for repair and it wasn't able to be fixed. Store supplied me with a certified letter from Apple explaining why

This review is for a iphone 11 pro i purchased, after receiving it powered up and showed a battery life of 93%, i have owned the phone for a little over three months and now the battery wont fully charge and i'm getting a message to replace the battery, so i took it for a battery replacement and the Apple certified service tech said the screws are messed up and the last person who worked on it did damage to them. He also mentioned the screen would probably break if they try more to get the screws out.  So be aware when purchasing an iphone from Amazon that the phone can be damaged with a bad battery.  Never again

Fast shipping for certain, the battery life was originally 91 I believe then after one update it went down 2 to 89. There was also some screen damage. A quart in. Gash in the screen I noticed when I took the screen protector. Wasn‚Äôt pleased with that cause if I‚Äôm paying high money for this the screen could have possibly been replaced beforehand. Otherwise not too noticeable if you don‚Äôt focus in on it. All in all the phone is decently good tho.

El tel√©fono no funciona la pantalla se cambia las aplicaciones, No me permite escribir bien y no hay como trabajar p√©sima inversi√≥n. Desde el principio estaba as√≠ fallando pens√© que mejorar√≠a pero ahora no vale en lo absoluto no puedo utilizarlo. Y nos tiene ni 3 meses ya que lo compr√© desde noviembre pero reci√©n lo pude ir a ver en febrero.

Tengo un mes con el tel√©fono y todo ah ido muy bien es r√°pido, llego muy bien como nuevo sin detalles y con un protector de pantalla incluido todo funciona como si fuera un iPhone nuevo. Lo √∫nico que cambia y en la descripci√≥n te lo dicen el cargador es diferente y no incluye los aud√≠fonos.

This phone came a day earlier than expected with a protective screen already on top. It comes with a charger cable and base both of which are third party items. It did not come with the adapter cable with headphones, unfortunately. The screen is also arguably third party but it comes it great condition and you can‚Äôt really beat that.

I‚Äôm only 3 days into using the iPhone 11pro. This is my first iPhone ever and I think I love it lol! As far as this exact device it‚Äôs flawless. It has a screen protector on it so I‚Äôm hoping that isn‚Äôt to cover up major scratches but the phone performs and looks perfect. Not a single scuff even on the bezel

¬†I have been trying to set up this phone for an hour now and have even called apple for help but ai have had no luck. This phone is absolutely terrible. I can even get to the home screen and it already has trouble.

Even though the listing gave the model number as A2160 (North America), I received model A2215 (UK/Europe). Both models are iPhone 11 Pro, but the A2215 will not work in North America due to the different cell bands. I don't know how to make sure you get an A2160 since the listing clearly states the product is an A2160. I'll be returning for a refund and looking elsewhere.The phone itself arrived early and is in great shape and I wish I could keep it, but it's a pretty expensive paperweight right now!

Ordered this thinking it would have some light scratches and OK battery health... Turns out, the phone was brand new. Pristine condition. 100% battery health. And I have the option to purchase an Apple Care plan within the next two months. Wow! For the price, I don't think I could have made a better purchase. Your mileage may vary, but this really worked out for me.

BUYSPRY, ECOMMERCE,AMAZON RENEW ARE ALL SCAMS. I AM NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE ITS PRICEY I BOUGHT 2 IPHONE 11Pros THE FIRST ONE COMPLETELY DIED MEANING DID NOT WORJ AT ALL DID NOT EVEN CHARGE. SENT IT BACK AND BOUGHT ANOTHER NOW HAVE SPENT $1700 I ASKED THEM TO PLEASE SEND BACK A GOOD ONE. SECOND ONE I BOUGHT WAS NOT UNLOCKED, HAD SCRATCHES AND SPEAKERS DID NOT WORK RIGHT. NOW THEY HAVE MADE ME WAIT OVER A MONTH TO RETURN MY MONEY. $1700 DOLLARS. THEY DONT RESPOND TO MESSAGES. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND BUY A NEW ONE. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY. EVEN IF IT WORKS FOR THE FIRST MONTH AFTER WILL PROBABLY GO BAD AND YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH A BROKEN PHONE. I PROMISE TO GOD THIS IS THE TRUTH. WHAT A SHAME ON AMAZON BECAUSE I AM SUCH LOYAL COSTUMER AND THEY APPROVED OF THIS DEFECTIVE SELLER. HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE HORRIBLE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. STAY AWAY IT WILL SAVE YOU MONEY, TIME, & A HEADACHE.

The phone I received had a broken/damaged speaker that made it so I could only do phone calls via Bluetooth. This ended up creating issues at work. Was unable to return phone as I could not be without a phone for work or afford to purchase a new one before a refund was issued. Unfortunate situation, wish the seller would have done their due diligence before sending out my phone, now I‚Äôm out $400+.

Ordered the 11pro Amazon preferred and received the phone and bright to my carrier (Sprint). The phone can‚Äôt be hooked to their network, so it‚Äôs not Unlocked. Called Amazon, got the runaround. They finally decided to replace with a different phone. 2 days late for delivery, at least I got a replacement, at least I have it, right? Wrong‚Ä¶.another trip to the carrier.  Guess what? Won‚Äôt hook to the network. Again, Amazon advertised that it would work for sprint. So now I have 4.5 hours of my time at my carrier and multiple phone Calls, approximately 3 hours, and still no phone. This was an extra bad experience with Amazon with a side of wasted time. Save yourself the aggravation and look elsewhere. With all of this said, I‚Äôve been a Prime member for 14 years or so and this experience has me seriously questioning my renewal with Amazon. Good luck.

Ordered mine from the seller BuySPRY -The first phone arrived with minor visible scratches along the rail - nothing I couldn't live with.But once in, it said ""Non-genuine Apple Display"" (see pic). Secondly the battery was almost degraded at 80%. Returned it for a replacement.The replacement arrived in even worse condition.1. The main camera lens was scratched (see pic)2. The screen had a tempered glass screen protector - to hide the fact that the screen underneath was indeed cracked (see pic)3. The front speaker was crackling - so it was definitely blown.4. The battery came at 83%This is really poor from Amazon Renewed. These products aren't even checked before sending off.Do yourself a favour and pay more for an Apple certified refurbished product instead.

If y‚Äôall looking to get a look like new phone. This isn‚Äôt the way to go. The one they gave me has scratches along the side and the top of the phone. It‚Äôs def not a look like new phone. The screen and the back look fine, but when looking along the edges and the camera there are hella scratches. If your not trying to save money just get a new phone, it‚Äôs much more worth it. This purchase I would say is not worth $750 for all of its imperfections especially when the description says ‚Äúminor to no scratches‚Äù. These scratches are not minor and I am dissatisfied.

I purchased this renewed iphone, and things were ok at first.  Had a few glitches with apps randomly closing, etc.  Nothing crazy.  Then the phone started shutting off when I opened certain apps.  Again, not a huge deal.  I thought maybe I didn't have it configured correctly, as a first time iphone owner.  But it kept getting worse.  Now 3 months in, for 2 days it shut off EVERY time I opened an app.  Now it won't turn on at all.  I spoke w/ Apple, they walked me through some steps to fix it, but they aren't working.  It is so corrupted that it won't update, and can't even do a factory reset/restore.  It's just stuck on the black screen.  Not happy with this purchase at all- a phone with this price tag should last more than 3 months.

I was very disappointed with my purchase! I knew i would get a refurbished phone so i wasn‚Äôt expecting a pristine phone, but i also didn‚Äôt expect such low quality for the $600 i spent on it! The metal surrounding the phone edges was chipped and full of scratches. I could live with that because i planned on using a case. But the big disappointment was in the huge scratches on the screen itself! It was very noticeable in every angle and lighting. I needed a phone immediately so returning it would leave me without a phone since i sold my old phone to buy this one. I ended up taking it to a phone repair shop to replace the screen since that only takes 30 minutes. I really thought i would get a better quality phone for my money.

Purchased this product only to find out when trying to change providers that the phone had a balance left on it from another purchaser. Consequently until the balance was paid the other person was considered the owner.  Obviously I paid the balance in full but can do nothing with the phone. Plus Amazon is not assuming responsibility or at this  out point even assuming any responsibility. I in the other hand am out over $1000.00.  Which no assistance in store. Pretty risky to purchase a phone thru Amazon.  Be very careful you may end up like me!!!!  Just to let you know this was an IPhone 11 pro.  The company Amazon subbed is not willing to refund it or exchange it.  I will never buy anything again without knowing where it comes from.

DO NOT BUY!! I regret buying this phone for this price. This phone shuts off or restarts itself about 2-4 times a day. The charger it came with sucks really bad!!!! I would return it but I had already paid to activate it. The phone itself does look nice and camera works great but this is the last time I buy a phone online.

I was really excited to receive it but it quickly turned to hell. You can't hear the phone ringing, notifications NOTHING. The volume is set up as far as it will go. If you are refurbishing these phones checking out whether or not the sound works should definitely be apart of that scenario. I'm returning for a full refund! I definitely should have listened to the reviews.

I try to exercise discernment when buying products of any kind.For example, car defects out of the factory, as opposed to a potentially sneaking car salesman neglecting to tell me about the transmission slipping. You won't know until you drive it.This phone looks great, functions well but the battery has a false bottom, and probably from water damage. It dies between the 10-20% threshold. Buyer beware.

Phone came thoughtfully packaged in an Amazon Renewed certified package, it also came packaged with a free screen protector which was a nice surprised, along with the advertised charging cable and SIM card removal tool.

I've had this for almost half a year now and I have had no issues. My refurbished XR came with 92% battery health and flawlessly accepted my e-sim from AT&T. The battery lasts practically all day with medium usage, only needing to be charged when I use it all day for games or streaming content. Coming from a 7, this is a huge upgrade. Face recognition is amazing and saves me so much time. The screen is also beautiful. It's a much higher resolution than on the 7 and it makes media consumption very enjoyable. I definitely recommend buying one of these if you are in need of a new phone but don't want to shell out top dollar for one of the newer phones from apple. It was so good I even bought another for my mom for her birthday!

I realize that this was a refurbished phone but the very reason I purchased it was to replace the same mode due to sound issues and this one was actually worst. It‚Äôs very low, especially on speaker. Can‚Äôt have a regular conversation as you can‚Äôt hear the person unless you connect headphones which aren‚Äôt available to me all the time. When playing music, the sound comes out ‚Äútinny‚Äù like when your Bluetooth speakers are dying or cheap. Great screen and picture quality though, along with all the other wonderful apps I‚Äôve come to appreciate with apple. I guess there may just be a sound glitch with this particular model as I haven‚Äôt had any issues with previous iPhones.

The phone is a good product but there are some slight downfalls for the product for example the battery life dies extremely quickly the face recognition is not that well because after a couple of weeks the face recognition will stop working and you will be forced to go to apple to fix the problem If you go into recovery mode it does not work 100% of the time. Although it has some downfalls i do recommend it to people who would like to use this product!

The phone was for my daughter as an upgrade to an aging iPhone 6S. All worked well - screen quality was nice, face recognition and all else seemed to work as it should, but it quickly became apparent that the battery life was not at all what it should be. Checking the Battery Health (under Settings>Battery>Battery Health>Maximum Capacity), it was at 63%. I would think a strong battery would be rule #1 when you send out a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone.After reaching out to the vendor, they agreed to replace it AFTER I sent the original one back to them. Two problems here - they seemed to expect me to pay to ship back their weak product and they expected my daughter to do without her new phone for what could easily have been 2-3 weeks. They did send me a shipping label after I asked for one but with a busy summer, the ‚Äúwithout a phone‚Äù issue was going to be a problem, along with the fact that I didn‚Äôt know where we would be when they decided to send the new one to us.As an alternative, I thought that maybe I should just take it to the Apple store and pony up the $69 for a new battery rather than risk getting another phone a couple of weeks later with a battery that was at or below the 80% that Apple recommends as a minimum standard.After running the diagnostics, Apple said all was good except the battery. While replacing it, they broke the screen and then said something about calibration issues. Long story short, my $69 got me a new (or at worst an Apple refurbed) phone. But this was a particularly lucky set of circumstances - and it wouldn‚Äôt have been quite so good had my daughter not just backed up all of her vacation photos before we took the phone in to Apple.Basically, if you get a phone from this vendor, you might get one with a junky battery and you can either deal with weak-ish customer service and go through the hassle of swapping it out via mail or spend $69 for a new battery at Apple. Maybe the Apple store will break your phone and replace it for free too. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I don‚Äôt usually write products review, but this time I feel like I have a responsibility to do so.I am the type of person that researches for days before buying something and this phone was no different. I was very hesitant because it‚Äôs the first time I buy a refurbished phone. Thanks to the Amazon 90 days return policy, I felt like I could give it a shot and if the phone didn‚Äôt work well, I was going to return it and buy a new one somewhere else. For my surprise and happiness this phone is perfect!No scratches front and back! It looks new!!!I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend you give it a try.

Bought this item in excellent condition refurbished, and was shocked to learn that the battery health was on 79%. For reference, I owned a phone for several years that never dropped below 90 percent until the very end of its life. Along with this, the screen is covered in small scratches, albeit they are not noticeable while the phone is in use.

buying an iphone off of amazon seems suspicious. i‚Äôve been using this phone for a week and i have not noticed any problems , cross my fingers and hope that i never run into any, the face recognition is alright it‚Äôs about what you would expect. the screen is beautiful, no scratches or anything. the outside of the phone was flawless, no dinks , scraps or anything. it charges beautifully, had 100% battery capacity. this was like a brand new phone and i‚Äôm very pleased. it wasn‚Äôt a stolen phone or anything as i was able to make an apple id with no issues. one thing is that the phone does get a little warm but honestly if you‚Äôre using your phone as chronically as a teenage girl like i am then it‚Äôs good.

I bought this phone back in December of 2019 and intentionally waited a few months to write a review to see how the phone behaved over time.Before buying the renewed iPhone XS off of Amazon, I had only bought brand new apple products from the Apple store. I would have never considered using an alternative site, until Apple raised it's prices on Apple Care. I have needed repairs on most of my Apple Products due to dropping my devices. I have no hate for Apple, but charging $250 for Apple care on phones is just not an option for me.I took a leap of faith and bought this version from Amazon. My XS came in the mail a few days later than expected (originally giving me the ""oh-crap-I-just-got-scammed"" feeling). Besides a few smudges which came off with some rubbing alcohol and the world's tiniest scratch--keep in mind, the renewed iPhones on amazon have to look like new from an arm's length away-- this phone is perfect.I genuinely have 0 complaints. The phone's battery has been consistent, I charge it for about 2-3 hours every 24-36 hours if I'm using the phone heavily throughout the day, and every 48 if not. It works flawlessly--it hasn't crashed, given me error messages, or refused to update (I've heard some horror stories about refurbished phones). Best of all, Amazon offers their own version of repair care for only $88.99 (comparable to Apple's old policy).Overall, if you're like me and you don't need the latest version of smartphones, but know you need an accident protection plan, then just get the Amazon renewed iPhones. It will save you hundreds of dollars and is absolutely worth it!

Es dif√≠cil tomar la decisi√≥n de comprar un iPhone de esta condici√≥n (renovado), en mi experiencia me arriesgu√© a comprarlo desde colombia a sabiendas de que devolverlo ser√≠a dif√≠cil y algo costoso.El iPhone XS lleg√≥ bien empacando, en una caja del vendedor (no la original).El celular en su estado exterior lleg√≥ muy bien casi que 0 rayones, el estado de la bater√≠a en un 86%.Escaneado con el programa 3uTools se puede verificar que todas sus partes internas son originales. No ha sido reparado.El √∫nico defecto que presenta y que es casi imperceptible es un micro ray√≥n en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla que para mi gusto personal no afecta en nada su est√©tica ni su funcionamiento, es algo con lo que se puede vivir sin lamentarse.Otro punto en contra es que el cargador y el cable no son originales, pero son homologados y funcionan perfectamente.En conclusi√≥n, mi experiencia en esta compra ha sido satisfactoria.

So basically you‚Äôre getting a refurbished iPhone with scratch free screen and back glass which is great, I was completely open to have a few minor scratches here and there and I was going to be ok with it, but I wasn‚Äôt okay with having all 4 edges of the phone full of Light to moderate scratches, battery health came as 95% which is not that bad, overall if you‚Äôre looking to buy a phone like this you would really have to think twice before making a purchase of you care about moderate scratches all around the phone, if you don‚Äôt, then this would be a perfect iPhone for you. One cool little touch is the SIM card pin, they include that in the box.

The phone came in near perfect condition. There was only a tiny smudge on the screen but with a screen protector it‚Äôs hardly noticeable at all. The battery life was still at 100% and I‚Äôve had very few issues with anything battery related. Excellent choice of phone for a not-too-expensive price.

The product was good. The only issue was that the charging brick was pretty bad, but I already had a 100 Watt charger anyways so it was alright. The phone was exactly as listed, the only issue I had was the 87% battery capacity and the ear piece speaker. But once I gave the phone a good clean with alcohol and cotton swabs, it was legit LOUDER than my 2 year old 11 pro max. It might be because my iPhone 11 Pro Max has been through a lot of things and a lot of water mostly salt water. Other than that the phone was 256 GB, and the color matched, it even came with a free screen protector, but unfortunately I never use cases or screen protectors. But I could see that as an advantage because the screen did have a handful of scratches. But it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker. Ever had to give the phone he waiting I‚Äôll give it is solid 7/10. That‚Äôs because of the scratches, earpiece speaker, and the crappy charger. But the phone service and I‚Äôm pretty sure A person who I‚Äôm gifting it to be very happy! üòò

Reasonable delivery time:  ordered on 1/4, delivered on 1/9.  Phone received in excellent condition.  No case scratches, scuffs, or dings.  Screen had one very small, very light swirl scuff that isn‚Äôt noticeable unless held in a certain position with the device turned off.  When device is on and screen is displaying the scuff is not visible.  Should also note that the scuff totally disappeared when I placed the tempered glass screen protector on the unit.  Most importantly, phone is fully functional.  Phone received with an indicated battery life of 87% maximum capacity, which I find acceptable for a ‚Äúrefreshed‚Äù phone.  Considering a ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù unit from Apple‚Äôs site was considerably more than this unit‚Äôs cost, I think this phone was a good deal.  Also, the fact that this purchase falls under the Amazon Renewed Guarantee (check it out) provided me with enough confidence to take a chance on buying a renewed product from Amazon.This phone was an upgrade for me from an iPhone 6, and after using the content transfer process to get the iPhone 6 content to the new phone, simply taking the micro-SIM chip out of the iPhone 6 and installing it in the iPhone XS completed upgrade process since I was staying with Verizon.  This worked flawlessly and I was immediately using the new phone with the content exactly as it was on the old phone.Bottom line:  This purchase of an Amazon Renewed iPhone worked out well for me.  I would consider going this route again for a phone and/or other items I might need.  Also, I would purchase again from the CellCow vendor as they delivered the product as advertised.

This renewed iPhone XS arrived from the seller Buy SPRY in perfect condition with 93% battery health. Included aftermarket box, compatible wall charger and cable with instructions.I spoke to associate before purchase and asked if this is fully unlocked and if will work with Sprint(Boost Mobile) since the description and details were contradicting each other. I was reinsured that it will work with Sprint CDMA network since is fully unlocked. When I received the phone, read included instructions there was a part in the bottom stating that this device is only compatible with GSM network for T MOBILE and ATT. Went step further and verified using devices sn# on network provider‚Äôs website and came back with the same massage stating this device is NOT compatible.Make the story short, it took a call to network provider customer service, explain the story that this is fully unlocked phone and pleading that it should work. Took the service rep about 5 min to make it compatible but could not use my existing SIM card nor other two spare ones. Had to wait few days for new SIM card to be sent. Once I got the new SIM card and went thru easy on-line activation, I was making phone calls with in 5 minutes.I recommend the renewed phone to any one who doesn‚Äôt want to pay ridicules price of new device and has little patience if same issue happens.

I was skeptical to buy the refurbished from Amazon an Apple phone for my Son.  But not until when the product arrived.  It had no scratch, dent or damage.  that's the first thing I checked.  The product packaging was as good as any amazon packing and with instructions of green package, it made me comfortable that amazon did take care of refurbished product.  Added to this the seller gave a case and screen guard which helped me not to find another product.  The only drawback was the original charger was missing.

Worked flawlessly after charging. I thought it would come with some battery life so I had a mini heart attack when it didn‚Äôt turn on but once charged everything worked great and I transitioned everything from my old phone with no problems. I upgraded from the X because I had a messed up screen and the battery life sucked. So far the battery life on the xs seems to be slightly better which is okay given that it‚Äôs basically the same exact model as the X internally. The only thing I‚Äôve had come up is that the flashlight seems to be a slightly cooler tone and dimmer than before? It could be a trick of the mind, maybe I had a dirty flashlight before, or it has to do with it being refurbished but it just feels a little different than the one on the X I had. Not a big issue just something I noticed. I haven‚Äôt taken too many photos that needed flash so idk if it effects the tone of the photos, but even if it does that‚Äôs fixable in editing.

Really nice quality. If you‚Äôre looking for a basically new phone, but don‚Äôt need the latest and greatest model, don‚Äôt hesitate to get this as it‚Äôs well worth the price. The phone looks almost new upon arrival, there were only very small scuffs on the edge of the screen. They were too small for me to even consider them scratches. And once I put a screen protector on, I don‚Äôt even see them. Obviously, if you want an absolutely perfect phone, maybe this isn‚Äôt for you. The battery health was at 92% when it arrived; I‚Äôm upgrading from an iPhone 6, so both the battery life and phone overall are a huge upgrade. If you‚Äôre new to buying a phone on Amazon like I was, I can confirm that the fully unlocked version of this phone does work with a Verizon SIM (I was a bit worried about that, the whole CDMA vs GSM thing goes well over my head). Anyway, overall really happy with this purchase thus far, I‚Äôll update this review if anything happens.

I absolutely love my new iPhone XS! It arrived on time and practically brand new. The battery health is at 95% so it‚Äôs practically a brand new battery in here. It‚Äôs a very beautiful looking phone and is very responsive especially with the face recognition. That works very well even in low light settings, or if you have sunglasses and a hat on. I was surprised at how accurate that was. The battery lasts all day easily and I‚Äôve hardly had any issues with apps crashing or anything like that.The phone itself was flawless and came with a protective film over it. There‚Äôs no scratches or signs of wear or anything to be found on the phone which I thought was great especially since it is an Amazon renewed item!I would definitely recommend this for anybody that is looking to upgrade their phone. The one I got is fully unlocked to GSM and CDMA networks so you can use it for any cell phone provider as long as you have a SIM card which it does not come with. It does come with a SIM tool as well as a generic charger and short cable which I just have tucked away as spares.

Purchases two renewed iPhones, one for my son and the other for myself and within six weeks experienced problems. On one phone the touch screen was not working in the center as shown in picture. This problem keeps going and coming. We use it as is.  On the other phone after attempting to do an update, the phone would not reboot with an error message 4013. Tried everything recommended online by the apple site. Had the phone assessed by an apple approved technician who said that it had a hard drive problem and paid $36 to repair.  It works now but not the Face ID.For both phones I reached out to the supplier and on each occasion I was given the opportunity to return the phones and get replacements or a full refund. However, because I live outside the US the costs of getting the phones on US soil was too much. So be wary if you live outside the US

Phone is practically perfect no scratches or marks at all I was impressed HOWEVER the speaker is blown so the audio is terrible and paying $460 I can‚Äôt let it slide I‚Äôll be returning and trying again. Also my Siri can‚Äôt hear me unless I‚Äôm actually yelling at it. UPDATE I sent the phone back and received the one i ordered (both phones came a day early) the new phone is in just as good condition AND the speaker works lol siri works a little better but thats apples problem i think so im happy it was a bit annoying to have to return the phone i dont know how they didnt check the speaker quality but i bumped it to 4 stars but well see how the return goes hopefully they get the phone and refund me. Definitely recommend buying though regardless!

Although the phone runs smoothly most of the time, it lags and has some glitches here and there. The battery has 84% battery life, which is part of the deal, but I can really tell that it isn‚Äôt the best condition for it and it gets really hot when charging. When it comes to aesthetics, there a few tiny scratches mostly in the sides that you can only see up close. Overall for the price, I think it‚Äôs a good deal.

This Iphone arrived a day early and in a nice box, worth every penny, i know you might be hesitant as it's a lot of money  but it's so worth it. My iphone 6s stopped working so i went all in and bought this, the speed this works at is crazy fast. Glass front and back so get a good case. My phone arrived with 93% battery life and a very long cord with a plug and the cord seems to be wrapped in some metal which is so nice and makes it very sturdy. The face id works so well, in the dark, the side of my face, when i'm crying and when i have glasses on. The camera is AMAZING quality it takes really good picture. the selfie camera is so good and the flash doesnt give that weird black and white fuzzy thing my old phone did when i used flash in the dark. This phone is such good quality and worth it, also when you turn the phone on its side it plays the audio out of both top and bottom making it super easy to watch Netflix or DIsney+. thanks for reading! sincerely a very happy Amazon costumer.

This is for sure a great phone I been using it for a little bit and I like it it works with the carrier I had no scratches no cracks camera works good Face ID works good it came well packaged that will protect the phone and I‚Äôm still worried how it‚Äôll do in like a week but hopefully it makes up for the long time it took to ship but it made up for it. The battery life is at 82% not what I like but it‚Äôs great for a used phone and hopefully this doesn‚Äôt mess up anything with my carrier but it works great makes phones I can send text so I‚Äôll see how it does sorry I can‚Äôt add photos because I writing this review on the iPhone XS I just baught

I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I previously had an iPhone 7 and was looking for an affordable upgrade. I got this XS 256GB for $520 and feel like it was an amazing deal. Out of the box, the phone had 100% battery health, no scratches, dents or blemishes, and was fully functional. In my case, you would never know that it was a refurbished phone.As far as the phone itself, I grow to love it more and more everyday. The OLED screen is incredible, face recognition is excellent, the camera and videos are really amazing, wireless charging is a great feature, and the battery life is such an improvement from my previous phone, which had the battery replaced once before. As a plus, iOS 13 runs beautifully on this phone and I'm really enjoying the added features. I could easily see myself having this phone for years to come, provided I don't break or lose it...Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an upgrade but wants to save $200+ dollars on a new iPhone.PS I purchased my phone with Kiss Electronics. The phone arrived earlier than expected. Weird packaging, but like I said, in perfect condition (as far as I can tell).

I received my renewed iPhone XS quickly after ordering it (24 hours) and it arrived in a dinky little box. Amongst the poor reviews were those who had too purchased a renewed/refurbished iPhones and were let down with very poor phone conditions and battery life.Much to my delight I was happy to see that the phone I purchased was in great condition. No noticeable scratches on the screen or back-glass. It felt brand-new. What reminded me it was not brand new was the 85% maximum battery life. Apart from that small downside, the phone works great with my existing SIM card from my old phone and it transfered all of my data and apps flawlessly.Great purchase from someone who was nervous about buying a $350 phone renewed.

I loved this phone up until a year later, it fell in water and the screen went out and now it won‚Äôt turn on or do anything. I lost all my pictures and important things I had because iCloud storage only holds so much. It was great up until this had happened. The battery did seem to die quicker after a few months of having it, and when I did receive it the glass of the camera was cracked but it didn‚Äôt bother me because it didn‚Äôt affect anything other than looks and I needed the phone then anyways so I kept it. All in all was a great phone up until recently.

Screen is amazing. Had to have OLED. It‚Äôs the only reason I didn‚Äôt want the XR.Feels premium in every way.Wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to keep it but it took about a day to know I could never give it up.It came well packaged with off brand charger. But the cord is really nice considering.Minor scuffs on metal and tiny scuff on bottom back glass. I was really really happy it was in such great condition. 89% battery.I hate that I love apple so much now. I had a Mac as a kid and kinda forgot how beautiful their OS and build quality is. But damn the cult of Mac entry fee is intimidating. And tbh it doesn‚Äôt replace windows for everything. But I‚Äôm slowly but surely going to own the entire ecosystem. And felt like and iPhone 7 wasn‚Äôt going to cut it. I‚Äôm really grateful my bf let me buy this. I hope you experience buying a refurbished iOS device is as great as mine was!Also be sure to order from an amazon endorsed seller, they give you more time to decide/be sure the device isn‚Äôt faulty.

¬†Delivery came faster than expected. The phone was prestine on the outside. Phone was white not silver but I loved that. I did not check battery capacity. There seemed to be zero issues until I opened the camera. As showen in video, there are green dots all over that also showed up in the captured picture as well. PLEASE CHECK ALL ASPECTS OF PHONE. Also I am not happy the inconvenience and difficulty of trying to return the defective phone. I had to print label, mail back to amazon pre-packaged via a ups and have to wait until it is delivered to get my refund(no option for them to resend a proper product). Being that I need a phone quick I had to pay another $400 for a new phone while I wait on my refund.

Screen has a bit scratched up very superficially but facial oils built up in ear speaker area. Battery charges very quick but battery life isn‚Äôt the best, I do use it for work though. Facial recognition is great and even catches the up-chin version of me and if I‚Äôm wearing glasses, much better than Galaxy s10 in that respect.

New to Iphones, previous galaxy guy.  Whole family was on Iphones but me.  The voice recognition ability of Siri is truly amazing compared to whatever  Samsung is using (Bixby?).  I hate typing texts, and like to speak them, and some of my previous ones on the old phone were either hilarious or embarrassing or both.  I think Siri learns heuristically because I rarely have to proof read what I speak now.  Being able to just say, ""Hey Siri, call whoever"" and have it happen is a big time-saver not having to look up the numbers.  It's like having an assistant in the phone, but not having to fool with setting it up.  You just speak to it.The phone itself appears new, not a scratch on it.  Battery life is at 86%, but I haven't been able to use it up in a day, so that works for me.  Learning how to navigate the phone is challenging, as many things sort of work like a Galaxy, but it can be frustrating.  But overall, I glad I made the switch.

Cosmetics of this product is great, I had no problems transferring my info/SIM card, and I‚Äôve been able to easily access anything via Wi-Fi or with my apps. However, phone calls are not very good at all. I can barely hear when it is on regular (and the volume is all the way up), so I have to put it on speaker to hear anything. And even then, sometimes it glitches and I can‚Äôt understand what the person on the other line is saying. I I have contacted the seller to see how we can resolve this issue.

It is a good phone for the price, like people have mentioned it comes in a generic box, which to me doesn‚Äôt matter, since it bought the phone and not the box. It did come with a few minor scuff, I mean to the point were you can barely notice them and if you have a case you will never see them. It does have a small scratch on the back glass which you can only see in the right light and hold the phone just right, and again you cant see it if you have a case. It did come with a screen protector which is a nice touch. Other than that, everything works and looks great. For $400 you really cant beat it. Im giving it 4 stars because of the small light scuff marks. Other than that I would definitely buy the phone again if I had to.

I bought this phone mainly for work. The battery lasts throughout the workday while I'm making calls, browsing the web, and managing social media accounts.I upgraded from an iPhone 7+ and the XS has a larger screen, but the phone itself is smaller and easier to use with one hand. After getting used to the lack of a home button, I've also noticed that I can do the same operations faster than before.The camera quality is great, especially in portrait mode. It really accentuates the details, and the built-in editor makes it easy to quickly edit and post photos.The video quality is also great for a phone. It's more than capable of shooting short films in 4k or 1080p (although it would help to have accessories).Finally, I love the seamless integration of Apple products. I can easily work on a project by going back and forth between my MacBook Pro and iPhone, and when I'm on the go and don't feel like taking my phone everywhere, I can simply wear my apple watch and keep up with notifications and stay in touch with friends and family.

I was excited to get the refurbished phone at a great  price, however after only one month all the numbers stopped working and the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù ! Truly disappointed but the real kicker was when I returned it for a refund within the return time, it just sat in the being returned position  and never moved to received and refunded.. I had to call Amazon and the customer service was amazing and immediately refunded it.. I would not buy from this seller anymore!!

I admit I was a bit anxious about buying a used cellphone because there are so many ways for it to turn out bad, but I am happy to say my fears were not realized. In fact the phone arrived earlier than Amazon predicted and the condition of the phone was better than promised. There are no marks or scratches on the device except for a couple of very faint scratches on the front screen that I can only see in bright lighting, at the right angle and from very close range. At arms length it looks brand new, and with a glass screen protector installed I can't see those faint scratches at all. Everything works perfectly and the battery condition is 100% which is amazing for a used phone. It may be two years old but for just one third the price of new this iPhone XS is a great deal.

I purchased the XS december of 2021, it is august 2022 and this phone has taken several mountain sized dumps on me but this last one has to be the biggest of them all. First off, facial recognition stopped working (literally within the first 6 months) I attempted to troubleshoot and nothing, gotta take it to apple for repairs. Then I notice the screen is touchy, keep needing to be recalibrated all the time and I'm doing it because naturally, I need my phone to function. Finally the final straw, last night out of nowhere the top half of my screen has become completely unresponsive. I cannot even enter my passcode to unlock it. (you know because facial recognition hasn't been an option in months) Once again I attempted to trouble shoot, hard reset and I even completely restored it hoping it was a software issue. Nope. It's hardware. Now my phone is stuck in the initial set up portion and I cannot even select English as my language because that part of my screen, is unresponsive. To say I'm extremely aggravated is an understatement. That cute ""to function like new"" statement in the description is a bunch of crap just like the device you'll be receiving. Shop elsewhere, otherwise you'll simply receive a device that works JUST long enough to survive past the return window. Absolutely ridiculous.

Looked good up until I tried to set up the facial recognition. It said it there was a problem with the TrueDepth camera, and facial recognition was disabled. It told me that I should update the software to resolve the situation, and if that didn‚Äôt take care of it, then I should take it to be serviced. I updated the software, hoping that would fix it, but to no avail. I will not pay more then I already have for the phone, so I am going to return it. Personally, if a phone says it is refurbished, that should mean all it's functions are in working order, has a good screen, and good battery life. It is fine for it to be dinged up a little, it's to be expected. But for one of the main functions not to work? Then the purchase was pointless, and has only made never want to buy a refurbished phone again.

My fianc√© purchased this phone for me just 5 months ago for business use. When I first turned it on, the screen wasn't working perfectly, but after a few tries, it was operational. Fast forward to this week, where the entire left side of the screen is defunct. I am not able to touch anything on the entire left side of the screen. This was a very frustrating issue, as I later on learned that these phones are not covered by AppleCare since they are used/refurbished. Therefore, any repairs/replacements must be done through the insurance purchased, Asurion, which charges a service fee. Long story short, I had to pay a service fee to receive a refund of this purchase, and now I am back to square one - searching for a new (fully operational) phone just a few short months later. Save yourself the hassle, purchase directly from Apple. There was no damage done to this phone, as it has remained in the office and is only used M-F, 9-5pm.

I think that given that this phone is refurbished the battery should last longer than two hours when I am listening to a podcast. I have to charge my phone mid-day if I have been using my phone heavily. The screen has three chips on the edges of the glass and has since cracked. I have not returned the phone because I figured that it was my fault, but given Amazon notified me that this product may have issues, I now think it‚Äôs flawed.

Nearly perfect. When received it I looked this thing over with scrutiny and magnifying glass precision. There was NO indication that it could have been used by ANYBODY, ever. None. Essentially, a new phone. Set up was a snap and it went right on the off brand the charger included. Then, because of the reviews, my next step was to check battery health. A disappointing 87%. Off the mark of the promised 90% by almost enough to be a deal breaker. But due to its pristine physical and aesthetic condition, it‚Äôs going to be a keeper. And after the last few weeks of constant use, it‚Äôs held steady at that 87%.

I typically buy my phones off Ebay as refurbished, but this is so much better! I searched for a good deal and finally found one! When buying a phone off Ebay, I noticed that it came with scratches and was pretty used. This did not! I bought it refurbished and I completely thought it was new. I've used it for about a month now with absolutely no problems! Well... Face recognition with the mask. Watch out for that. This seller is great and it even came with a charging port and cord! So far I haven't found any known scratches and I don't believe there are any. Highly recommend!

I love my iPhone XS. It was in excellent condition with new charger and cord. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because the phone restarts periodically on its own. I took it to the Geek Squad at Best Buy to run a diagnostic check to find a possible issue, but could not locate exactly what was causing the phone to restart. It does not happen all the time, but when it does, it can be annoying. I am still within my 90 day return window, so I will determine what to do if it becomes a bigger issue. But for now, I really like this phone, but wish operation was smoother.

I was upgrading from a 6s plus. It arrived earlier than expected, and the front screen was great looking, however‚Ä¶. Both aluminum sides were completely top to bottom full of scratches, there was also scratches around the camera, and the speaker on the front had a dent in it. The battery was at 84% which is lower than my current iPhone 6s Plus üòÇ so for over 350 dollars I really wasn‚Äôt that impressed, I know it‚Äôs refurbished, just not worth a couple hundred dollars to me? I returned it, they were really far with my refund so I will give them that! I was worried about losing my button but the facial recognition was honestly pretty quick every time.

The phone came in great condition and still works well with the exception of the cellular signal not working after the first few months. I took it to get it fixed and the technicians told me there was a 50% chance of destroying the phone completely to try to fix it. After further research, this seems to be a common issue with the new update of iPhone X. Everything else about the phone is great so it's a shame that I can no longer use it as a primary phone and am now having to invest money again into a new phone only a few months later. Usually phones last me 2+ years.

The received phone was beautiful, in excellent physical shape with no blemishes.  The battery level was at 82%, which was slightly disheartening to me, as I previously purchase an iphone 6s from Verizon Pre-owned with an excellent battery health.  I was expecting something similar with this phone, but that wasn't the case.  I did reach out to the vendor about my concerns, but I did not receive a response from them.  After a couple of weeks, I noticed that the earpiece speaker was crackling when I played song files on the phone.  This discovery unfortunately led me to request a replacement phone, but I was not aware that Verizon Pre-owned does not offer replacement items.  So now I am waiting on a refund.

I am extremely disappointed with the product. 5 months after purchase and the display is not working. I have two friends who have bought their phones from here and they were happy with it. That is why i decided to also go here to buy a new phone. However, I regret not taking the negative reviews into consideration before buying a refurbished iPhone. First off I realized soon after receiving my iPhone XS that it would heat up pretty quickly and become pretty hot. It bugged me because I spent 670 dollars after tax and I felt that after spending that amount it should have worked optimally. I regret not returning right then and there, but I brushed it off because I felt that I was being to picky and it wouldn't be a big deal. A couple months in my screen randomly went completely white. I tried rebooting it and accidentally called 911 twice. I couldn't cancel the call because the screen wasn't showing. Anyways after sometime the screen went back to normal except a very small portion in the upper left corner where the battery percentage shows was completely black. It did not affect my usage since it was a small part of the screen so I just continued on with it like that. I was just happy the phone turned on. Fast forward to now the entire screen is black. I thought my phone had died so I put it on the charger to no avail. I can tell the phone is on. Hey Siri worked but the frickin screen is black. So take heed to this review if you are thinking about purchasing. I feel frustrated and unlucky that the phone I happened to get was so janky.

I was very hesitant about buying an iPhone off of Amazon, but I did it and was not disappointed. It came with 100% battery life, so it basically was brand new. It came with a charger and cube (plug), but that's it. Sorry to disappoint those who into that airpod life.No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down. But what it lacks in that feature, the iPhone delivers in the portrait camera mode, I seriously am in love with the blur feature.Sincerely,A very satisfied Amazon customer

I ordered an iPhone XS from the seller BuySPRY. At first glance, the phone appeared to be in excellent condition, with no dents or scratches on the back or sides of the phone. It also arrived with a maximum battery capacity of 85% which I was ok with, as well as a charging cube, cord, and a SIM card ejector tool. However, the phone came with a screen protector that hid many scratches. This included a scratch that ran the entire length of the screen. The scratches are noticeable at arm‚Äôs length with the screen off. Even though I didn‚Äôt see the severity of the scratches until I removed the screen protector to put on a different one, I felt that it was dishonest not to disclose the condition of the screen.

Buying an iPhone XS at a discounted price (due to being used) seemed like a great value.  Unfortunately, I have now purchased and had to return 2 of these phones due to different problems that had apparently not been fixed or observed during refurbishing. Both phones looked brand new. The first phone had a problem with the touch screen right out of the used box. I worked with tech support initially but after a hour on the iPhone thinking the problem was corrected, problem resurfaced.  The second XS worked normally for about a week but then the display would occasionally distort for a minute or so.  For the potential savings it may be worth the possibility of getting a beautiful used phone.  You do have 90 days to evaluate and the vendor is very good about handling returns. If I could I would give 5 stars for appearance, and customer service but 2 stars to represent my luck in getting a solid iPhone XS.

First off the few pros: The condition of the device itself was really good and came with solid battery health (94% on my unit)The main con and why I returned the device was the aftermarket LCD screen it had installed instead of OLED which the iPhone XS should have. The entire point of buying a XS is because you want that nicer screen otherwise I could have just got a XR instead. The LCD screen also has a slightly thicker bezel near the bottom. I will not buying phones again from Amazon Renewed as you just don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting and the seller might have replaced the screen or replaced other parts without disclosing it. I‚Äôve usually bought my phones and tablets through Swappa and never had a issue on there + you can actually see the device you are getting. I will be using them again instead.(In the photo on the left is the XS with the LCD screen and on the right is my 11 Pro with the original OLED screen. If the XS was using a OLED screen it would have been pure black.)

The product came with a Amazon renew box with charger and screen protector, face ID works perfect, no scratches, 89% battery life (for being a second hand product it‚Äôs just fine), original screen.For those pre-k please who still have the iPhone 6s or 7 and don‚Äôt want to invest a great amount of money buying the 11 or 11 pro, this is a great option (was my case).

I saw some reviews that were questionable. However, when we got this phone there was not a scratch on it, battery life was great, and it was reset to factory settings. My husband switch his SIM card and was ready to go. Backed it up to his ICloud and everything from old phone was fully restored all the way down to the screensaver he had. He is pleased with his new phone.

For the price you can‚Äôt beat it. Battery life is at 91%. There is a spot on the screen that is flawed, the glass must have been repaired or something and it‚Äôs raised up a bit. But to be fair I didn‚Äôt notice it until I put a case on it and it looked like a bubble in the case but I realized it was the glass. Doesn‚Äôt seem to interfere with the touch screen and although it‚Äôs kind of a bummer it‚Äôs not enough for me to return it.

The cellphone I bought is a renewed one, it came almost perfect, screen and back pannel PERFECT not a single scratch, BUT the bumper really showed it was a used device, not new and clearly used, however, cellphone works just fine, nor a single problem and battery status is at 86%, once again, not new but not bad.

So battery life is at 84. Would have definitely liked better.  Minimum was set at 80 and will probably have to replace soon. Still a good price for phone even if I do a battery replacement.  Positives phone is in great shape screen and back are perfect. Seller included a case which wasn‚Äôt included in description which was a nice touch.  Shipping took forever with fed ex six days longer than it said at time of purchase but seller shipped same day so not a problem with them.

I didn't want to be saddled with a yearly contract, nor could I afford a new phone.  This is unlocked which gives me the opportunity to choose which provider best fits my current needs.  I am presently in North Carolina, will eventually be  spending time in Massachusetts and will also be in England for up to 6 months.  I do travel quite a bit and this phone allows me many advantages.

I switched to this phone from a Samsung galaxy S8+.  As an iPad user, I was attracted to the continuous ecosphere Apple offered.  There was a mild hiccup in transfer, as all my sorted photos transferred into a single album on the iPhone. After some sorting, though, I have no regrets whatsoever.  The capability of this phone, despite it being one model year old, is striking (Many of its features are superior even to the current iPhone 11, including the OLED screen).  The battery life has been better than expected for a renewed device, likely because it is only one model year old.  I have larger hands, but I prefer the 5.8 inch size for one-handed use.  If you are looking for a foray into the Apple ecosphere, this opportunity is hard to beat.

When I got the phone it was a little dirty, and it wasn‚Äôt perfect but it worked. None of it was anything I really cared about. The problem for me; less than a week after the warranty expired I had to replace both the battery and the screen. The screen developed a dead spot and the battery was getting below 80% which is when Apple recommends replacement. Between the two replacements and having a tech savvy buddy willing to help it costed about $130. If I went to a store for replacement- like most people- know it would have been more.

Great phone. My only complaint about buying refurbished was the screen has two very minor blemishes on it. I can only see them when the screen is off. Does not affect my vision when the screen is on. I love that it came with a screen protector already installed. I have not had any issues with the phone. So far it‚Äôs a great refurbished phone.

My wife loves it.  The box it arrived in was garbage and looked like it had been stepped on.  Lucky for me I had an old iPhone X box that worked much better for presentation.  No scratches on the screen with minor scuffs around the sides, but is in a case so you can‚Äôt tell.  It only has 94% max battery life but I guess that‚Äôs to be expected.  Oh and it only came with a charger and cable.

Phone is basically brand new with only some delicate scratches on the front screen that aren't that noticable. The phone is fully functional. Works great and has the GB I needed. Cameras are perfect. Battery life could be the tiniest bit better but is perfectly fine otherwise. I was worried about buying an iPhone from Amazon and from a seller that wasn't Apple in general but I am overall happy with my purchase and am glad I took the risk because I now have a better phone and didn't spend a fortune on it.

I bought the 256GB XS from Kiss Electronics INC. The phone arrived with 93% battery and was in generally good condition. There are a substantial amount of scratches on the screen, but they aren‚Äôt visible when the phone is in use. All aspects considered, I feel buying refurbished through Amazon/Kiss Electronics seems to be a better deal than buying the phone new (especially when including an insurance policy with the purchase).

If you compare the price/quality ratio with other refurbished services such as Apple, you'll get a great value for what you're paying. However I don't really know what refurbished is to them, since my screen had a little black dot in the upper left corner. It really doesn't bother me, specially for the price I paid, but the seller should warn customers this can happen, and not sell it as a renewed phone.

Excellent costumer service. No sassy snips or anything. They were understanding. The phone itself has no scratches on the back, the front came with a screen protector.The ONLY reason why I'm returning this is because of the BATTERY. It's at 89% battery life but that's not the issue. It Won't last more than ~2Hrs with moderate use. My old android lasted longer (its just getting really slow and the battery isn't replaceable). Like 6 hours longer doing the same stuff. I googled and from what I found, its probably the IOS update its on 13.4 and from what I looked on the website- XS/MAX/XR and older was screwed over with some battery drainage bug.

I have a tiny, local phone company out of small town in Texas and was worried it would not be compatible but it works perfectly! This is how I will continue to purchase my phones. The charger that came with it didn‚Äôt work very long but that is not a big deal to me.

I was hesitant on purchasing an iPhone thru Amazon however this seller really went above and beyond. The phone came with 100% battery life, had a screen protector, and came with a charger and charge box. Got this phone connected right away with no problems. There were no scratches or chips on paint.

The phone itself works fine and was able to transfer the information over my my previous phone. There was a scratch on the outer camera lense that caused photos and video to be very blurry. It costs $119 to fix the outer camera, and was only offered $20 to help have it fixed.

This phone was pretty scratched up on the silver outside rim of the phone.  The back and screen were fine.  Phone was installed and data moved over, but face recognition and portrait mode did not work on this phone.  Tried several troubleshooting methods on blogs, but nothing fixed it.  Had to return the phone.  Battery also seems to go down quicker than my previous iphone 8.

Even though it‚Äôs renewed, it looks brand new. I was able to update it to iOS 14.3 with no problems, and all the features work as expected. Delivery was also really fast, so can‚Äôt complain.This is still a good phone to own, as it feels fast, and with the latest updates you can get by.

Now I was very skeptical about making this purchase but I must say well done. The phone is in immaculate condition everything works, the only downside from making this comparable to a brand new device however is the battery health it's on 83% but who's complaining. Will definitely be purchasing again in the near future.

The phone worked fine for the most part.... kinda.On the first day it already had glitches with the unlock screen & momentary unresponsiveness with the touch screen. But compared to my last phone, I didn‚Äôt mind it much.Then one day, almost a month after purchasing, the lock screen just stopped working completely. Couldn‚Äôt unlock my phone at all. I figured, restart the phone it‚Äôs fine. And for a while, that seemed to work. Until after a few minutes of use, black lines just started appearing on my screen vertically. And glitches on the screen.So the phone was slightly damaged all throughout my usage, even tho I bought the best condition! But it still performed decently besides the occasional glitching.With refurbished iPhones, these things can happen & you sometimes might get unfortunate. Some of them will never  function well, no matter how many times it‚Äôs repaired/renewed.Giving one star for leaving me off the grid for 2 weeks waiting for refund & forcing me to deal with a subpar phone while I had it. Got a new one, same model and now ik what THIS phone SHOULD have been like. Pales in comparison, immensely!

Amazon Renewed description is ‚Äúworks and looks like new‚Äù. I received it with a light scratch on the screen and battery life at 90%. Amazon may say that up to 80% is ok, but my current iPhone is at 87% battery life and can‚Äôt go without charging every 4-5 hours. So 80% is BS.I‚Äôll keep the phone as it is a good value for the money and i need a phone. I can pay Apple to change the battery in a year, but honestly, I think I‚Äôll tell my friends to get refurnished from Apple. It has a better warranty, new case and battery. Worth the additional expense, in my opinion.

The phone itself had zero issues with it didn't even see a scratch was just disappointed in the 91% capacity it had when other people get 100% here.. They do state the minimum is 80% so there's nothing against the seller here. Just know it's a dice roll to see what kind of phone you get. The price I paid (420) was just too good to be mad at though.

Make so to test and inspect the major aspects of the phone. For example, battery, face ID, phone call connectivity, and screen. I have gotten phones with very used battery life, it would disconnect from calls randomly even with good cell service, the face ID sensors eventually stopped working after a few weeks, and I could also tell that the screen was clearly a 3rd party screen replacement. I noticed when swiping up to see all my apps that I was not smooth and that the 3D touch was activate too easily. I compared it to my friends phone and i could see that the color and quality was not there and that clearly the 3D touch was off which are all tell tale signs of 3rd party screens.

Phone had minor superficial scratches on the screen but they weren‚Äôt terrible. Overall the physical appearance of the phone was fine. However, once I set up the phone I could not set up the Face ID and it was glitchy. Wether I was trying to surf the internet, change a setting, or in an app, the phone would jump back to the previous page and then forward to the page I was on, then back, then forward and it wouldn‚Äôt stop doing it. It would also open apps on its own. Very disappointed because it looked decent for a used phone and had a battery health of 90% but it was unusable.

Avoid the seller Buyspry! I bought a phone for my daughter and it wasn‚Äôt working right within weeks. I returned it and bought another one hoping it was a fluke because the seller came recommended. That one seemed better so I assumed we were good.Bought myself one from BuySpry and that one had problems. Returned it and bought a new iPhone SE 2020 instead.Now, months later, my daughter‚Äôs phone isn‚Äôt working right. There are various problems, the main being that the touchscreen is off, making texting difficult, trying to buy things or play games is difficult. Anything you use the iPhone for is incredibly frustrating.I reached out to the seller but it‚Äôs past the return window (May 2020) and they advised me to get it fixed at a local shop.Again, avoid the seller BuySpry. They‚Äôre reconditioned phones are terrible and it‚Äôs not worth the money.The XS itself, is only okay. My SE 2020 Is the only winner in this and we could‚Äôve gotten my daughter one for the same price or less than the useless piece of junk BuySpry sold us.

¬†So I‚Äôve had this phone for two weeks now. At first I loved it because it was an upgrade from my iPhone 6 but recently it keeps glitching? As the video it acts on its own and does its own thing whenever I‚Äôm doing something. Turning it off doesn‚Äôt help either? I‚Äôd love an exchange but I‚Äôm forced to just return it so.

Was skeptical about purchasing seller refurbished phone.  Received a quality looking product, packaged decently.  There are a copy small scratches on the screen, but that's expected for a used phone.  The battery life is 100% and so far, the phone has worked flawlessly.  The XS is a huge upgrade from a 7.

I hate that I have to review this negatively by the phone stopped working within two days. The back glass of the phone and the camera had obviously been tampered with. There are chips in the middle of the phone where it looks like they opened it and didn‚Äôt seal it properly or at all. There is a large gap on the edge of the camera. It looks like they took the phone apart and reassembled it very Messily. The camera is foggy and the screen won‚Äôt turn on. I am assuming that this is from moisture getting in the faulty seal.

i bought the phone less than a month back. However the battery does not last even a month. Rest of the phone seems to be ok. However i thought the battery will last at least a few days. I stop charging around 7 am after it reaches 100% overnight and the battery completely drains by around 4-5 pm everyday. So basically it seems like the battery is good for 10 hours max

The phone is a great phone definitely an upgrade from my iPhone XR. Camera is much better and so is the processor. However, I gave it 4 stars because it stated no visible damages, scratches, Etc‚Ä¶noticeable but there are just a few tiny nicks on the sides that I assume are from a case that‚Äôs is not so forgiving when taking on and off. Other than that, Nothing noticeable and the battery life is at 94% which is better than I anticipated. The 5g and quickness is also an upgrade.

The phone is mostly ok. The screen has an issue (there is a small area that looks faded one the sceeen is off, noticeable when screen is on), however, biggest issue and why I gave 3 stars is because the Esim is still locked to AT&T, the previous carrier of the phone. Which means I can never have two numbers in this phone. I will contact Amazon about this and update this review based on their response.

This iphone 12 battery health was less than the 90% they say on the product description. The phone also had a very visible ding on both sides of the power button and to top it all, the return process was much worst than other product. Amazon requires UPS to pick up the item at the address where it was delivered and that cost me a day's work.

If you‚Äôre on a fence about buying a refurbished iPhone don‚Äôt be. This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone purchase and it‚Äôs totally worth every penny where you‚Äôre saving hundreds from other comparable refurbished ones or more than 1/2 of the original new MSRP.

Received iPhone 12 securely packaged with a new charger and pin to remove sim card. Cosmetically the phone looks great. So far it has been functioning well too. I am hoping this one will last us, our last refurbished phone from a different reseller had issues within a year.

Even though the phone did not show up in an Iphone box, you would never guess it was refurbished.  No noticeable flaws at all.  Came with charger and cord.  Best part is the battery life charges to 100%.  I ordered this for my teenager who has been asking for an Iphone.  No way could I afford a new one and I refuse to be tied to a network contract.  Phone came completely unlocked and my teenager is so happy with everything about the phone.  I explained that it most likely would not have a battery that charges completely since that is what is stated per Amazon so we are surprised that the battery charges 100%.  The pricing I found to be acceptable after doing pricing research.  I will be ordering another one in the near future.  Thank you

No Frills, arrived as advertised, phone felt like someone used it for a few months before trading it in for a newer model. Lifelong android user and this was my first iPhone (GSM Carrier). I was able to put my SIM in and my phone was online and working within the hour. Had the phone for a bout a week now and the hardware feels great - I feel confident that the battery is at least at the 80% level that they say it is.If I have to be picky, there is a minor scratch that can only be seen if the phone is held at a sharp angle to the light. There is also some scuff marks on the sides where the phone was potentially rubbing on something. Both of these extremely minor gripes vanish when I put on a screen protector and a phone case.Final Verdict: I'm very happy I made this purchase and it was fantastic value. I got over the ""renewed"" feeling pretty quickly, but I can see how that might bother some people.

Clearly, this isn‚Äôt the best photo of the phone. Sorry about that. What I will say is, there are absolutely no visible damages to this phone- not on the screen, any of the cameras, the sides or edges, and not on the back. The phone operates like new- and in fact, If I bought it without realizing it was renewed, I would have thought it to be brand new. I think perhaps the only thing is that the sound clarity was iffy at first, but that could have just been me because it is absolutely fine now. I wanted to wait the full 90 days before giving an honest review, but so far everything has been fine. The battery life is superb- it is 6:10 PM now and It‚Äôs battery is at  75% without charging and with a decent amount of use during today. I really am enjoying the phone so far, however if anything changes, I will probably edit this review.In short, I do believe the purchase was worth it!

I ordered a renewed and unlocked iPhone 12  with 128 GB of storage from Amazon. I wanted to try one out (my previous smartphones except for my first one were all Androids). I also wanted the flexibility of paying the phone off when I wanted to instead of being stuck on a ""forever"" installment plan. Buying this phone was a great decision. I love my iPhone. If you're worried that a renewed iPhone won't be as good as a brand new iPhone, don't be. The front of the phone is in pristine shape. The glass on the front has no scratches whatsoever. The back has very few (and I literally mean very few) scratches. You can't see them from arm's length like the listing says. You can barely see them unless you hold it up to a light. The sides of the phone are in perfect shape too. It makes calls, send texts and messages normally. The camera is in perfect shape and takes amazing pictures too. This model of the renewed iPhone costs about 50 bucks less than a brand new one with the same storage. If you're looking for a good value on an iPhone or a replacement phone for a family member then I'd consider a renewed iPhone. Its a winning decision.

The I phone 12 arrived quickly but was poorly packed. It was delivered loosely in a bubble sleeve in a box in a plastic mailing envelope.  The sleeve was inadequate to keep the phone from rattling around inside the box.  The phone was listed as excellent, same as new, but the phone had noticeable scratches on the top area of the screen.  Other than those two gripes, the phone otherwise was in excellent shape and was able to be initialized properly.  After staring at the screen scratches for a few hours, I decided to return the phone, at my own expense.

It worked right away, I‚Äôm not entirely used to IPhones so I did have a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to use it. Now that it‚Äôs been nearly a month since I bought it, it works fantastic, the storage is great and I didn‚Äôt even notice any superficial damage like the product says it does.

Phone came with a broken ear speaker. For some reason, neither of the speakers were inspected according to the Amazon Renewed ""20-Point Inspection Test Certificate"". There is visible damage to the ear speaker as per the photo attached. These parts should also be tested. The phone cannot be used as a conventional phone with this broken critical part. I will be returning this phone; very disappointing.Edit: (Adjusted from 1 to 3 stars) Immediately after returning the phone, I purchased an identical one. I‚Äôve had it for about 6 months and it works great with no issues. No damage, scratches or other wear. The phone is fast and battery is normal. When it comes to used items like this, it‚Äôs a gamble. Thankfully there is a return policy when you get a bad apple.

I hope they send me a new one or I will be going somewhere else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ These guys actually repackaged the same defective cell phone and sent back to me.

Everything is good, my battery life is on 82 percent is my problem. My iPhone 11 I have had since they came out is on 83. I wouldn‚Äôt care if it was at like 90 but 82 will only last a few hours. I don‚Äôt want to wait another week for a new phone.

Lo consegu√≠ con un costo promocional de $13,100 MXN. Por ese precio es un equipo muy bueno que no le pide nada al modelo 13 e incluso 14, ya que las √∫nicas diferencias est√°n en el chip, el video y un par de cosas m√°s como los 6 meses de Apple Music. Ahorrarse entre $5,000 y $8,000 por tener casi lo mismo es una gran ventaja, con eso f√°cil te compras los Airpods Pro.Fuera de eso, la calidad (en mi caso) fue muy alta, ya que el equipo lleg√≥ en excelente estado (como nuevo, sin rayones, solo con cargador y cable) y hasta el momento totalmente funcional.Recomendar√≠a comprar aparte un cable USB-C a Lightning para aprovechar la carga r√°pida y una buena funda para que luzca.

Hice un estudio previo a la compra asi que el iPhone llego como se supone que llegan todos los Renewed, la caja en perfectas condiciones y con lo prometido. El telefono SI tiene signos asi que le dare en estetica un 9/10 tiene 3 ""picaduras"" en los marcos y un muy peque√±o raspon en el borde de la camara. La pantalla tiene muy pocos ara√±azos, nada que impida el uso de la pantalla ademas que el protector hace que se vea impoluto. La bateria llego en 90% y el cargador incluido es funcional a mas no poder, inclusive quise hacer la primer carga con un cargador rapido de Samsung y no quizo, solucion: usar el incluido generico. El software esta bien, la compatibilidad con la telefonica (Telcel) a la primera, 4G y 5G funcional, y todas las conexiones funcionales. En pocas palabras hice una prueba general que me llevo un dia y medio y nada fallo. La bateria no tiene problemas, la pantalla no tiene problemas, las camaras funcionan perfectamente. Creo que abriendo la mente a pensar que es un celular seminuevo te das cuenta que es una excelente compra y que te ahorraste un muy buen dinero.

He comprado antes equipo electr√≥nico ""refurbished"", ""open-box"", y un Iphone X ""re-acondicionado"" hace 3 a√±os que finalmente ha fallado y quise reemplazar con el modelo 12, pues para m√≠ representan un gran retorno de valor por mi dinero; sin embargo creo que est√°n pervirtiendo malintencionadamente el uso de la palabra pues la unidad que recib√≠ es simple y llanamente usada. En la imagen incluido se aprecia el da√±o que presenta la carcaza, que ser√≠a lo primero que espero sea re-acondicionada, pero pero a√∫n, al encender el equipo el sistema indica que la vida de la bater√≠a est√° al 86%, misma que debi√≥ ser ""re-acondicionada""; entonces no entiendo qu√© es lo que dicen que garantizan en el re-acondicionamiento, simplemente deber√≠an decir unidad con dos a√±os de uso y listo, si alguien lo compra sabe qu√© esperar. Las estrellas otorgadas son por la r√°pida atenci√≥n al env√≠o, aunque puedo suponer la urgencia por deshacerse de inventario muerto. En apple el totalmente nuevo est√° s√≥lo cuatro mil pesos m√°s, que es lo que har√© √©sta vez: ir a la segura con el nuevo

Me gust√≥ mucho el iphone 12 que compr√© ya que ten√≠a 92% de bater√≠a y una est√©tica de 9.8, recomiendo al vendedor BuySPRY.

Aunque es verdad que cuenta con buena est√©tica dentro de lo que cabe (porque tanto la bocina de arriba como el micr√≥fono y altavoz est√°n sucios), me lleg√≥ con 88% la vida de la bater√≠a ü•π, se comporta bien, pero con otros proveedores es raro que llegue por debajo de 90%, de ah√≠ en fuera todo excelente.

La descripci√≥n del producto era de condici√≥n excelente, da√±os no visibles a m√°s de 30 cm y aparte, un equipo supuestamente ""renewed"". Ven√≠a totalmente golpeado, la pantalla rayada e incluso levantada, como despegada y quisieron ""enga√±arme"" poni√©ndole una mica. Terrible experiencia, no vale para nada la pena, est√°s comprando un producto peor que usado, porque mi celular actual tiene 5 a√±os conmigo y no tiene la cantidad de golpes que este supuestamente renovado. Ya hab√≠a comprado por amazon renewed y fue impecable, pero esta vez s√∫per mala experiencia

En general, el equipo est√° en muy buenas condiciones. La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° al 100%, est√©ticamente no tiene ning√∫n detalle ni en la parte trasera ni en los laterales y todo funciona perfectamente.Lo √∫nico que no est√° en tan buena condici√≥n es la pantalla, que cuenta con algunos rayones visibles y que son m√°s profundos de lo que esperaba de acuerdo a la descripci√≥n del producto, pero debido a que lo dem√°s est√° en perfecto estado no me molesta.En cuanto a los accesorios, no son originales; el cable me parece bueno pero el cargador si me parece de mala calidad por lo que no lo us√©. Adem√°s, el equipo ven√≠a con un cristal templado instalado, lo cual se agradece.Definitivamente me parece una muy buena compra, con el √∫nico detalle de que la condici√≥n de la pantalla fue peor de la esperada.

El estado era casi perfecto, un peque√±o golpe en  una esquina y un ray√≥n menor, marca condici√≥n de bater√≠a al 100%, el sistema no marca reemplazo de bater√≠a y marca justo 12 meses de uso, el problema es que la bater√≠a si bien dura, no llega al nivel de una bater√≠a al 98% de uno uso con el que pude comparar, por lo cual me hizo sospechar que fue alterado el software.Casi todo funciona bien pero algunas apps se traban o como en el caso de Tik Tok, se queda pegada una canci√≥n del video anterior.Lo devolv√≠ porque no me dio confianza esas fallas random de software.En mi caso era la versi√≥n premium ,Vendido y enviado por Amazon USA

Para ser un equipo remanufacturado, est√° en buenas condiciones. La pantalla, sin rayones y el funcionamiento de hardware y software est√° bien. s√≥lo unos detalles m√≠nimos de est√©tica en la parte inferior. lleg√≥ bien empacado.El √∫nico problema es que necesito factura y a la fecha el vendedor no la ha enviado despu√©s de varias solicitudes.

Honestamente si he comprado bastantes productos refurbished y la gran mayoria me han salido muy buenos, pero este se llevo la corona. El iphone me lleg√≥ con 98% de bater√≠a, mica de cristal templado y Apple Care con vigencia de 7 meses el d√≠a de la compra. Desconozco si todos vengan en esas condiciones pero al menos el m√≠o si lo tra√≠a. Lo mejor de todo es que por comprarlo en los d√≠as del prime day, me cost√≥ un 40% menos de su precio original!

El telef√≥no me llego en 1 d√≠a, me llego con la cajita generica igual que el cargador, el dispositivo fisicamente tiene solo 2 golpecitos uno en la parte de abajo y uno cerca de la camara, pero no afecta nada a la camara solo es un peque√±o rayoncito en el borde que cubre a la camara, fisicamente es un 9.5 funcionalmente jala bien la vida de la bateria es de 87% hay gente que les toca suerte y sale arriba de 90 pero bueno esperemos que no afecte en su funcionalidad

El producto llego en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, 100% de vida util de bateria e inclusive tenia un protector de pantalla ya instalado, estuvo perfecto.El unico detalle, viene con un cable muy corto y un adaptador de corriente de pocos watts, es necesario comprar los aditamentos si quieres conseguir una mejor experiencia pero comparado con uno nuevo y sellado que tampoco viene el cargador si es un buen ahorro, lo recomiendo si buscas no invertir tanto en un telefono de esta gama.

Es el segundo iPhone 12 que compro y el primero me llego con 89% de bater√≠a y en est√©tica un 9 y este √∫ltimo me llego con bater√≠a 100% y est√©tica al 10 pr√°cticamente podr√≠a decir que era nuevo.

Me anim√© a comprarlo pues necesitaba cambiar mi anterior tel√©fono. Al leer los comentarios fue que me convenc√≠, de ve casi como nuevo, leves detalles de en la parte de la c√°mara que se despint√≥ pero es menor a 1mm, son solamente dos puntitos. As√≠ en otras dos zonas que siendo honestos apenas y se notan, con funda ni siquiera sabr√°s que no es nuevo. Todo funciona perfecto, bater√≠a al 91%, muy satisfecho con la compra. Viene en una caja genetista con cable ‚Äúhecho para iPhone‚Äù y un cubo gen√©rico, adem√°s de cubierto en una pel√≠cula para evitar rasgu√±os en el tel√©fono, no me arrepiento hasta ahora.
