UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

works good  for compute tasks due to high vram, have not tried with gaming, but im sure its fine as well. you NEED to download the fan tool (firestorm) or your card will overheat and die, but thats minor.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B08W8DGK3X,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B08W8DGK3X,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Muy buena, la ped√≠ a Colombia y llego en buen estado, una observaci√≥n es q cuando jugaba en todo en ultra a 1920x1080 dependiendo del juego subia a temperaturas de 80¬∫ a 85¬∫ me di cuenta que si le quitaba la tapa lateral bajaba a 75¬∫ 72¬∫, por lo que me toco cambiar los ventiladores del gabinete y la fuente a una 750W para poder ponerle una mejor refrigeraci√≥n, ahora me va a 69¬∫ 65¬∫ sac√°ndole el m√°ximo provecho

B08W8DGK3X,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

B08W8DGK3X,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

B08W8DGK3X,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended

Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B07Z8PWC6R,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Just got the card for my build and so far it's been great, runs Modern Warfare at 144+ frames with all high settings and goes well with my 5800x. Would recommend.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Muy buena, la ped√≠ a Colombia y llego en buen estado, una observaci√≥n es q cuando jugaba en todo en ultra a 1920x1080 dependiendo del juego subia a temperaturas de 80¬∫ a 85¬∫ me di cuenta que si le quitaba la tapa lateral bajaba a 75¬∫ 72¬∫, por lo que me toco cambiar los ventiladores del gabinete y la fuente a una 750W para poder ponerle una mejor refrigeraci√≥n, ahora me va a 69¬∫ 65¬∫ sac√°ndole el m√°ximo provecho
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

B07Z8PWC6R,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.

Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

This GPU runs at 100% only by using phoshop or a DAW and it becomes sooooo laggy. Don‚Äôt expect to run multiple screens or game with it. Completely a lost of money.

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.

I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B07Z8PWC6R,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"

This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.

B07Z8PWC6R,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Upgrading from a GTX 1070 to this, finally the GPU shortage is done. I have this to play on my new monitor that plays in 4k 160 hz and this beast can perform beautifully.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Best video card you can get for $799.  Screams through all games, and even FS 2020 cannot stop it.The build quality is excellent, and it even comes with a brace / support bracket for the card.

I chose this one instead of 3080 (I had FE before ) and i'm happy with it1440p nice performance, I love Radeon chill feature and Adrenalin dashboard. Build quality is really nice.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

B097YW4FW9,"
This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

works good  for compute tasks due to high vram, have not tried with gaming, but im sure its fine as well. you NEED to download the fan tool (firestorm) or your card will overheat and die, but thats minor.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B097YW4FW9,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B097YW4FW9,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Muy buena, la ped√≠ a Colombia y llego en buen estado, una observaci√≥n es q cuando jugaba en todo en ultra a 1920x1080 dependiendo del juego subia a temperaturas de 80¬∫ a 85¬∫ me di cuenta que si le quitaba la tapa lateral bajaba a 75¬∫ 72¬∫, por lo que me toco cambiar los ventiladores del gabinete y la fuente a una 750W para poder ponerle una mejor refrigeraci√≥n, ahora me va a 69¬∫ 65¬∫ sac√°ndole el m√°ximo provecho
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B097YW4FW9,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B097YW4FW9,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B097YW4FW9,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

Es muy buena, a parte de jugar se puede usar con el programa Nvidia Broadcast, no se calienta mucho, en furmark va hasta casi los 68 grados lo cual es bastante bueno ya que mi anterior tarjeta llegaba a los 95, casi no se escucha mientras funciona, todo OK!

Ten√≠a un 3400g, hace un mes que tengo la gr√°fica, y la verdad que me ha funcionado perfectamente en todo los juegos, en la mayor√≠a de juegos en los maximos gr√°ficos  me va a m√°s de 70 fps, tengo un 5600x y si alguien tiene una preocupaci√≥n por el ruido de los ventiladores, la verdad que son super silenciosos y tambi√©n cuando la gr√°fica no tiene mucho uso se apagan los ventiladores, la verdad la recomiendo.PD: Revisen las medidas de su case antes de comprarla porque es medianamente grande

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B097YW4FW9,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

beautiful
"
B097YW4FW9,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B097YW4FW9,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended

This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B097YW4FW9,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card. Btw, 550w PSU is the MINIMUN for this card.)Ryzen 5 5600gRTX 3060 ti (jeje)16 gbs ram (dual channel, 3200mhz.)500gbs ssd m.2550w PSU.3 FansAir coolingAlso, I bought it from amazon.com USA (sold and shipped) and it arrived without any damage, everything was perfect.
"
B09719T6FT,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Just got the card for my build and so far it's been great, runs Modern Warfare at 144+ frames with all high settings and goes well with my 5800x. Would recommend.

Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.

B09719T6FT,"
Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

B09719T6FT,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09719T6FT,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B09719T6FT,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.

Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09719T6FT,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B09719T6FT,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!
"
B09719T6FT,"
The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

This GPU runs at 100% only by using phoshop or a DAW and it becomes sooooo laggy. Don‚Äôt expect to run multiple screens or game with it. Completely a lost of money.

B09719T6FT,"
Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09719T6FT,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09719T6FT,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.
"
B09719T6FT,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09719T6FT,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B09719T6FT,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09719T6FT,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B09719T6FT,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B09719T6FT,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.

As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Upgrading from a GTX 1070 to this, finally the GPU shortage is done. I have this to play on my new monitor that plays in 4k 160 hz and this beast can perform beautifully.

Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.
"

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games.

It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B09QVPMGYV,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.

Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

Es muy buena, a parte de jugar se puede usar con el programa Nvidia Broadcast, no se calienta mucho, en furmark va hasta casi los 68 grados lo cual es bastante bueno ya que mi anterior tarjeta llegaba a los 95, casi no se escucha mientras funciona, todo OK!

Ten√≠a un 3400g, hace un mes que tengo la gr√°fica, y la verdad que me ha funcionado perfectamente en todo los juegos, en la mayor√≠a de juegos en los maximos gr√°ficos  me va a m√°s de 70 fps, tengo un 5600x y si alguien tiene una preocupaci√≥n por el ruido de los ventiladores, la verdad que son super silenciosos y tambi√©n cuando la gr√°fica no tiene mucho uso se apagan los ventiladores, la verdad la recomiendo.PD: Revisen las medidas de su case antes de comprarla porque es medianamente grande

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.
"

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

beautiful
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"

Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

B09QVPMGYV,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

Great graphics runs all of my games well at a good fps and a good quality. I have had no problems with it. Only thing that I don‚Äôt like is that the zotac logo is yellowed on the fans. Other than that great buy.

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended

This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.

Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

After a couple months of use, I can run any game I have installed at 1080p and highest settings. Once I get a 1440p monitor I will update this review with results. Top tier GPU, will run anything.

The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.

Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.

I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B08P3YT3MY,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B09Q98KRTG,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

B09Q98KRTG,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

Works nicely with my CPU and fits my motherboard perfectly, already noticing much higher frame rates and performance

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

B09Q98KRTG,"
I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

beautiful
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

B09Q98KRTG,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B09Q98KRTG,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

B09Q98KRTG,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

I've been wanting this card since I built my pc because I was doing an all-white build, and I noticed a big difference right away since I was upgrading from a 1660 Super.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

eficiente la compre para jugar jugar a 1080p y no me ha fallado, excelente rendimiento para los juegos que he usado, entre ellos destiny 2 a full, dark souls 3 full y elden ring medios(iria mejor pero me falta un procesador mas potente actualemente esta con un athlon 3000g con 16gb a 3200mhz)

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

B09Q98KRTG,"
I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

I picked this up for my daughters computer, and it's more powerful than my evga FTW3 1080TIOC.  Consumes barely any power as well!

B09Q98KRTG,"
This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Graphics are great and I wasn't dissatisfied. Was watching the prices fluctuate and eventually got it for $329+ tax. When I started looking, it was at $430.My previous experience was a nvidia geforce 630 and it blew me away. <insert ""a whole new world""-aladdin>

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada
"

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.

B09Q98KRTG,"
Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09Q98KRTG,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings

B09Q98KRTG,"
I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

B09Q98KRTG,"
Best video card you can get for $799.  Screams through all games, and even FS 2020 cannot stop it.The build quality is excellent, and it even comes with a brace / support bracket for the card.

B09Q98KRTG,"
Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games.

It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B096YQ6WVW,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

B096YQ6WVW,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.

Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.

great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

I bought this for my grandson who didn‚Äôt know his granny had any knowledge about ‚Äúcomputers and stuff‚Äù.  Install was easy and he was back to gaming in no time.  Since it wasn‚Äôt a present he paid me back in almost all singles and a few ten dollar bills. Love that boy!

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

B096YQ6WVW,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

B096YQ6WVW,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

B096YQ6WVW,"

"
B096YQ6WVW,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"

This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.

B096YQ6WVW,"
Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

Intel on board graphics card was constantly crashing Windows 11. Got this and no more crashes, works for office uses and streaming. Probably will not do for mid to high end gaming,, didn't bother trying.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

B0B5B7J74M,"
I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B0B5B7J74M,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Muy buena, la ped√≠ a Colombia y llego en buen estado, una observaci√≥n es q cuando jugaba en todo en ultra a 1920x1080 dependiendo del juego subia a temperaturas de 80¬∫ a 85¬∫ me di cuenta que si le quitaba la tapa lateral bajaba a 75¬∫ 72¬∫, por lo que me toco cambiar los ventiladores del gabinete y la fuente a una 750W para poder ponerle una mejor refrigeraci√≥n, ahora me va a 69¬∫ 65¬∫ sac√°ndole el m√°ximo provecho

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

B0B5B7J74M,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

B0B5B7J74M,"
I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

B0B5B7J74M,"
I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

B0B5B7J74M,"
I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

"
B0B5B7J74M,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

Couldn't afford a 3070 esp when it was 1000 when i bought it but this GPU nearly performs similar but 200 dollars less.

Card runs phenomenally. Not super noisy, which is nice, but a huge upgrade from my old 1050ti. As much as I hate that I bought it from a scalper, I‚Äôm glad to finally have my pc done.

This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

B0B5B7J74M,"
This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B0B5B7J74M,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

works good  for compute tasks due to high vram, have not tried with gaming, but im sure its fine as well. you NEED to download the fan tool (firestorm) or your card will overheat and die, but thats minor.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B08V1WK4LB,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B08V1WK4LB,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

B08V1WK4LB,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

I bought this for my grandson who didn‚Äôt know his granny had any knowledge about ‚Äúcomputers and stuff‚Äù.  Install was easy and he was back to gaming in no time.  Since it wasn‚Äôt a present he paid me back in almost all singles and a few ten dollar bills. Love that boy!

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.
"

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

beautiful

B08V1WK4LB,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

B08V1WK4LB,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B08V1WK4LB,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

B08V1WK4LB,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic.

I picked this up for my daughters computer, and it's more powerful than my evga FTW3 1080TIOC.  Consumes barely any power as well!

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Decent 30 series under 350. Runs tests and games no problem. Quiet fans.

Graphics are great and I wasn't dissatisfied. Was watching the prices fluctuate and eventually got it for $329+ tax. When I started looking, it was at $430.My previous experience was a nvidia geforce 630 and it blew me away. <insert ""a whole new world""-aladdin>

¬†Meanwhile in the video it sounds, in real life it‚Äôs really half as loud as the mic captures, you won‚Äôt notice it, actually the case‚Äôa fans, are the louder stuff in there. (Recorded while had gpu at 100% and at open case; with closed case it‚Äôs much less)Now that it‚Äôs cheaper really adds value

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

I bought a cheap bare bones desktop and of course games on Steam wouldn‚Äôt work right. Super laggy. Put this graphics in and now the games run perfectly. Easy to install too.

Intel on board graphics card was constantly crashing Windows 11. Got this and no more crashes, works for office uses and streaming. Probably will not do for mid to high end gaming,, didn't bother trying.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Upgrading from a GTX 1070 to this, finally the GPU shortage is done. I have this to play on my new monitor that plays in 4k 160 hz and this beast can perform beautifully.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Best video card you can get for $799.  Screams through all games, and even FS 2020 cannot stop it.The build quality is excellent, and it even comes with a brace / support bracket for the card.

I chose this one instead of 3080 (I had FE before ) and i'm happy with it1440p nice performance, I love Radeon chill feature and Adrenalin dashboard. Build quality is really nice.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

works good  for compute tasks due to high vram, have not tried with gaming, but im sure its fine as well. you NEED to download the fan tool (firestorm) or your card will overheat and die, but thats minor.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

B09C43DLXG,"
I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Just got the card for my build and so far it's been great, runs Modern Warfare at 144+ frames with all high settings and goes well with my 5800x. Would recommend.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09C43DLXG,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B09C43DLXG,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!
"
B09C43DLXG,"
I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
MSRP is $579.00

B09C43DLXG,"
The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09C43DLXG,"

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B09C43DLXG,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

B09C43DLXG,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"

I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.

Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.

Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage

Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09C43DLXG,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

Card runs phenomenally. Not super noisy, which is nice, but a huge upgrade from my old 1050ti. As much as I hate that I bought it from a scalper, I‚Äôm glad to finally have my pc done.

This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B09C43DLXG,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09C43DLXG,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

B09C43DLXG,"
Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I Was upgrading from a 1050 TI which could barely run Cyberpunk at 30 frames Now i run it at 60 with ultra and RT
"

works good  for compute tasks due to high vram, have not tried with gaming, but im sure its fine as well. you NEED to download the fan tool (firestorm) or your card will overheat and die, but thats minor.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.

This card is the top of the line for the technology I had available in my case. I can play all the games I have currently at full settings and with no issues. Excellent card if you have slightly older motherboard and processor.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B09256CTT3,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Just got the card for my build and so far it's been great, runs Modern Warfare at 144+ frames with all high settings and goes well with my 5800x. Would recommend.

Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.

B09256CTT3,"
Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Muy buena, la ped√≠ a Colombia y llego en buen estado, una observaci√≥n es q cuando jugaba en todo en ultra a 1920x1080 dependiendo del juego subia a temperaturas de 80¬∫ a 85¬∫ me di cuenta que si le quitaba la tapa lateral bajaba a 75¬∫ 72¬∫, por lo que me toco cambiar los ventiladores del gabinete y la fuente a una 750W para poder ponerle una mejor refrigeraci√≥n, ahora me va a 69¬∫ 65¬∫ sac√°ndole el m√°ximo provecho
"
B09256CTT3,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09256CTT3,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B09256CTT3,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B09256CTT3,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B09256CTT3,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B09256CTT3,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0

Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09256CTT3,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

I bought this for my grandson who didn‚Äôt know his granny had any knowledge about ‚Äúcomputers and stuff‚Äù.  Install was easy and he was back to gaming in no time.  Since it wasn‚Äôt a present he paid me back in almost all singles and a few ten dollar bills. Love that boy!

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B09256CTT3,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

beautiful

B09256CTT3,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09256CTT3,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B09256CTT3,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!
"
B09256CTT3,"
The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

This GPU runs at 100% only by using phoshop or a DAW and it becomes sooooo laggy. Don‚Äôt expect to run multiple screens or game with it. Completely a lost of money.

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

B09256CTT3,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09256CTT3,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09256CTT3,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B09256CTT3,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09256CTT3,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B09256CTT3,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B09256CTT3,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09256CTT3,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B09256CTT3,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09256CTT3,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B09HHLX543,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Just got the card for my build and so far it's been great, runs Modern Warfare at 144+ frames with all high settings and goes well with my 5800x. Would recommend.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Muy buena, la ped√≠ a Colombia y llego en buen estado, una observaci√≥n es q cuando jugaba en todo en ultra a 1920x1080 dependiendo del juego subia a temperaturas de 80¬∫ a 85¬∫ me di cuenta que si le quitaba la tapa lateral bajaba a 75¬∫ 72¬∫, por lo que me toco cambiar los ventiladores del gabinete y la fuente a una 750W para poder ponerle una mejor refrigeraci√≥n, ahora me va a 69¬∫ 65¬∫ sac√°ndole el m√°ximo provecho
"
B09HHLX543,"
Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09HHLX543,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B09HHLX543,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B09HHLX543,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B09HHLX543,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

B09HHLX543,"
MSRP is $579.00

B09HHLX543,"
The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09HHLX543,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09HHLX543,"

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09HHLX543,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.

I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09HHLX543,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09HHLX543,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B09HHLX543,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09HHLX543,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

Card runs phenomenally. Not super noisy, which is nice, but a huge upgrade from my old 1050ti. As much as I hate that I bought it from a scalper, I‚Äôm glad to finally have my pc done.
"

This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B09HHLX543,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B09HHLX543,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B09HHLX543,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09HHLX543,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Best video card you can get for $799.  Screams through all games, and even FS 2020 cannot stop it.The build quality is excellent, and it even comes with a brace / support bracket for the card.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

B09Q9SX3NY,"
Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

works good  for compute tasks due to high vram, have not tried with gaming, but im sure its fine as well. you NEED to download the fan tool (firestorm) or your card will overheat and die, but thats minor.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

B09Q9SX3NY,"
I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

B09Q9SX3NY,"
I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

Es muy buena, a parte de jugar se puede usar con el programa Nvidia Broadcast, no se calienta mucho, en furmark va hasta casi los 68 grados lo cual es bastante bueno ya que mi anterior tarjeta llegaba a los 95, casi no se escucha mientras funciona, todo OK!

Ten√≠a un 3400g, hace un mes que tengo la gr√°fica, y la verdad que me ha funcionado perfectamente en todo los juegos, en la mayor√≠a de juegos en los maximos gr√°ficos  me va a m√°s de 70 fps, tengo un 5600x y si alguien tiene una preocupaci√≥n por el ruido de los ventiladores, la verdad que son super silenciosos y tambi√©n cuando la gr√°fica no tiene mucho uso se apagan los ventiladores, la verdad la recomiendo.PD: Revisen las medidas de su case antes de comprarla porque es medianamente grande

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

The hardware is great but the software is terrible. Just like a buddy told me before I bought this.The shipping needed work too, claimed brand new but came with a return label inside

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

I bought this for my grandson who didn‚Äôt know his granny had any knowledge about ‚Äúcomputers and stuff‚Äù.  Install was easy and he was back to gaming in no time.  Since it wasn‚Äôt a present he paid me back in almost all singles and a few ten dollar bills. Love that boy!

For the price, this is a very nice graphics card. Good speed, graphics, install and configuration.

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

After a couple months of use, I can run any game I have installed at 1080p and highest settings. Once I get a 1440p monitor I will update this review with results. Top tier GPU, will run anything.
"

beautiful
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

This GPU runs at 100% only by using phoshop or a DAW and it becomes sooooo laggy. Don‚Äôt expect to run multiple screens or game with it. Completely a lost of money.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended

This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09Q9SX3NY,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal.

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Performs very well, and keeps good temperatures while being very quiet. Mine seems to have some buzzing / coil whine, but it isn't annoying. I can usually only hear it if I put my ear up to my desktop.

Just got the card for my build and so far it's been great, runs Modern Warfare at 144+ frames with all high settings and goes well with my 5800x. Would recommend.
"

Bought this from Amazon open box. Absolutely no issues so far and no indication of issues down the road. Can 1440p game ALL day long.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB

This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
MSRP is $579.00

B07TZ4VFB6,"
The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!

this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

B07TZ4VFB6,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.

Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!

The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Great product, rapid shipping.  Thanks, would buy again.

Nice for work with many screen!

This GPU runs at 100% only by using phoshop or a DAW and it becomes sooooo laggy. Don‚Äôt expect to run multiple screens or game with it. Completely a lost of money.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B07TZ4VFB6,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

With GPU prices falling, Nvidia RTX 3060 TI is the best home user all-around graphics card. Best balance of price vs performance. In general,GeForce video drivers are more stable than the red team‚Äôs options. Used in my HTPC.
"

Couldn't afford a 3070 esp when it was 1000 when i bought it but this GPU nearly performs similar but 200 dollars less.
"

Card runs phenomenally. Not super noisy, which is nice, but a huge upgrade from my old 1050ti. As much as I hate that I bought it from a scalper, I‚Äôm glad to finally have my pc done.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
This card is very noisy when running high demand games. I use MSI afterburner to overlock which may impact the sound, however with my other cards this isn't a problem. Will be looking for a replacement 3060ti soon.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

I've been wanting this card since I built my pc because I was doing an all-white build, and I noticed a big difference right away since I was upgrading from a 1660 Super.
"

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.
"

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.
"

eficiente la compre para jugar jugar a 1080p y no me ha fallado, excelente rendimiento para los juegos que he usado, entre ellos destiny 2 a full, dark souls 3 full y elden ring medios(iria mejor pero me falta un procesador mas potente actualemente esta con un athlon 3000g con 16gb a 3200mhz)

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
I was running on a 1660 that came with the pre-built and it was time for an upgrade.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B07TZ4VFB6,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Upgrading from a GTX 1070 to this, finally the GPU shortage is done. I have this to play on my new monitor that plays in 4k 160 hz and this beast can perform beautifully.

Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings

I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Best video card you can get for $799.  Screams through all games, and even FS 2020 cannot stop it.The build quality is excellent, and it even comes with a brace / support bracket for the card.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.
"

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.
"

This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.

This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!

I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

I got this because I feel like the 3060 Ti strikes a pretty good balance between a lot of things -- including the oft-forgotten questions of power usage and heat production.  Performance-wise people point to the 3070 and say go ahead and spend the extra, but I do want to point out that the 3060 Ti generally outperforms the previous generation's 2080 Super in most things (and barely does any worse at all in the things it doesn't beat it at.)  Zotac's offering is a good price and seems to be a reliable choice which was my biggest consideration right now (I want this thing to last a long time.)The only complaints I do have are about the cooling.  The heatsink's design is actually really good and I don't have any complaints about the heatsink itself.  It's worth noting that many videocards have the fins oriented vertically instead of horizontally, so so air can flow through them out the back of the case (thus meaning those cards can only recycle air and rely on the case to have good airflow.)  This one is properly oriented horizontally, so *some* air can go out.  I emphasize some because of two things.  First, it's open on both sides, so of course some air still goes back to the case out the inside part and gets recycled -- but of course GPU fans rarely have high static pressure anyway, so blocking that side doesn't actually improve cooling (mind you, my case has pretty decent airflow, so it may do better to cover the inside end in worse cases than mine.)  I do also think the fans should be tilted just ever so slightly to actually make the air go a direction other than straight down into the heatsink, but I don't know if any videocard manufacturer has ever thought of this yet.I also noticed the thermal paste apparently wasn't ideal or at least wasn't ideally placed (maybe too much I think.)  I took it apart under the assumption they used the usual really cheap stuff many GPUs have, but it looked like it maybe wasn't actually terrible.  I can't be sure what it is from just its appearance alone, but it did seem to be a bit lower viscosity than ideal, so maybe not the highest grade.  When I changed the thermal paste its temperatures dropped by approximately 3C from the top and close to that at idle (and thermal paste is less about maximum temperature and more just about minimizing heat dissipation latency, so when you see a notable drop in temperature that means a lot more than it may seem.)  It may just have been too much on there as there was definitely quite a lot and it was hard to clean, so that is a distinct possibility and could potentially even save them money if it's just a matter of reducing it ever so slightly.There was one definitely bad choice on this card I'm unhappy about though -- and this is the biggest reason I knocked one star off from the max (the other stuff is pretty typical of GPUs in general probably.)  For some reason they stuck little aluminum tags with their name and logo on the fans themselves with a heavy foam tape.  This just seems like a really dumb choice no matter how I look at it.  For one, it adds extra mass to the fans, which reduces their efficiency and lifetime.  For another, apparently the process varies because on mine one of the tags was off center and looked kind of bad (plus was probably even worse for the lifetime of the fan as it would make it run fairly unevently, affecting its long-term life.)  Again, my goal is for this thing to last, and if the fans die out on me not that far down the road that's definitely not lasting.  Since they used a thick foam tape though, it's hard to get them completely off (I had to pry very very carefully and slowly to not risk damaging the fans in the process.)  Actually, this may have had some effect on the temperature in itself since the fans now probably run that tiny bit more efficiently (but doesn't account for a full 3C.)Now, that said, I've seen reviews saying this card is loud.  I don't know if they've revised this model or what, but I did not feel like the fans were loud at all.  I get more noise from the other fans in my case definitely (mind you, it's not a silent case by any means, but I never feel like the noise is bad now.)  Certainly a lot better than the awful stock cooler that came with my CPU (that thing started to reach hurricane levels under load I swear.)  Also, the GPU seems to actually stay a very good temperature.  The reviews saying the fans were loud said it would run > 70C, but, in fact, I'm seeing a maximum of around 61C or so now (slightly higher before) with normal gaming keeping it at about 57C or so roughly the majority of the time (versus 60C before I redid the thermal compound.)  It only got up to around 61C or so when I saw GPU usage go way up to about 85% (normally it's 50-60 in most games but some hit the mid 70s or so.  That 85% was only for a short duration.)  I have a very high confidence now that this card will last me a very long time short of something unexpected and extreme happening.  Overall I'd call it a good design other than those few points I mentioned earlier.

It is a pretty good card. The noise is not actually annoying, you just gonna hear a whisper, but if you have headphones you will not hear it. The only ""bad"" thing here is the temperatures. The minimun and maximun i get when i am not doing gaming is 32¬∞ and 40¬∞. When i am playing triple A games (God of war, Spiderman, etc) i get 75¬∞ as minimun and 88¬∞ as maximun. But, the performance of this card is just amazing, I love it. In God of War (all in ultra, at 1080p without dlss) i get more than 70+ fps, but if i change graphics at high, i get more than 100+ fps.My pc (just in case for the people that have 550w PSU and have fear to buy this card.

"
B09VYDTVGY,"
The temps while gaming were a tiny little bit on the high side right after install, but that is due mostly to my PC not having the greatest airflow, which I am now in the process of fixing. Later on the temps stabilized, with DLSS Quality at 1080p I get 65 degrees max. Full resolution Ray Tracing might push it to 80 degrees, which is fairly normal. Me personally, I don't care about 2k and 4k right now or for the foreseeable future. Seamless 60 FPS, VSync is your best friend here. I am adoring this thing.

After the graphic card price surge of 2020 and 2021, it's good to finally see the prices of cards start to reach regular levels. While NVIDIA seems to be grasping at every dollar on the 3000 series cards, was able to find this for the same price as the Founder's Edition during the Prime Day Deals. Very happy with the ability of the card. Fans can be heard a bit when heavy use but nothing out of the ordinary.

Good price , powerful little card, very noisy in my case. My 2060 never got as loud as this card did, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cause it is the OC edition and my b460 d3sh does not support over clocking so maybe that had something to do with it, but it got pretty damn loud. But i had a i5 10400F in at the time which bottlenecks it especially in 1080p but I was still getting around 140 frames with high settings in 1440p. Also, this Is obviously a 2 fan GPU, I feel like 3060 ti and up you should look for a card that has 3 fans for better cooling and noise. I returned it not even 10 days of owning it for the evga FTW 3070 which is suppose to have GREAT cooling.

Definitely a good mid-tier GPU finally at a decent price. I got it for not much over MSRP. If you can get the 3070 for 500 or less I would go for that still though. I'm not sure why anyone would say it runs hot or needs better cooling. Mine runs at a steady 65c while under stress and 35c idling) I also undervolted it just a little (925mv @ 1950MHz and +350 on the memory clock)
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away

What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.

Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

Es muy buena, a parte de jugar se puede usar con el programa Nvidia Broadcast, no se calienta mucho, en furmark va hasta casi los 68 grados lo cual es bastante bueno ya que mi anterior tarjeta llegaba a los 95, casi no se escucha mientras funciona, todo OK!

Ten√≠a un 3400g, hace un mes que tengo la gr√°fica, y la verdad que me ha funcionado perfectamente en todo los juegos, en la mayor√≠a de juegos en los maximos gr√°ficos  me va a m√°s de 70 fps, tengo un 5600x y si alguien tiene una preocupaci√≥n por el ruido de los ventiladores, la verdad que son super silenciosos y tambi√©n cuando la gr√°fica no tiene mucho uso se apagan los ventiladores, la verdad la recomiendo.PD: Revisen las medidas de su case antes de comprarla porque es medianamente grande

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

I paid $500 this new most 3080s are like $800-850. This performs near a 3080 running it with a 12700F on a 550w psu no issues

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

I bought the RX 6500XT at a time when most GPU's where priced at double their usual price, if not more. At the time, it was a good price and despite people trying to tell me that it's not an upgrade from what I was using, it actually is.  I game at 1080p. This GPU will do it. It's only down side is that it has 2gb less RAM than my previous card. However, it makes up for it and I don't really notice it. Most of the games I play run better. The few that don't at least matches what my previous GPU can do.  If GPU prices were what they were last year, then I would buy this card again. If you play the wait and see game, then you don't know how long you'll be waiting. I couldn't afford to wait. When this RX 6500XT came out, I jumped on it and I don't have any regrets.
"

I had an old gt630, so this has been an excelent  and cheap upgrate, I'm more a casual gamer so I don't have any problems playing at lower resolutions than the average, however it doesn't mean that the graphics sucks, opposite graphics in medium, lower and sometimes higher settings look great, I wouldn't recomend this grapgic to anyone who want to do video edition or streaming. On the other hand the deliver was fastest than expected and the graphic was properly packed and of course completely new. So far so good, It's almost perceptible the noise while playing and the fans stop while you're not doing something demanding. Long story short, great purchase for someone looking for a cheap but efficent graphic card, specially if you come from a lower specs card. Btw I'm using PCI 3.0
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Okay so I'm not a pro gamer,.I'm a software developer that needed a gfx card to use with my new build for work and a 34"" 144hz 4k ultra wide curved monitor, it did exactly that. I also run Ubuntu 22.04 which AMD offers open source drivers for open gl. Out of curiosity I thru a few Linux 3D games at it, plus Mindcraft with a realistic shader... And it plays 4k max settings on all games and has about 40 - 60 fps which I was very surprised to see. So I'm extremely happy with this purchase

This card vastly improved my performance over the integrated solution in an AMD A10 processor.  It gave a good performance boost over the previous video card I replaced.  I did not expect perfection, but this did exceed my expectations based on the technical reviews. I was pleased with the performance paired with my A10 processor, but since I have upgraded to an Ryzen 7 5600X, I suspect this is now a bottleneck of the system.I would recommend this paired with a slightly less powerful processor as it gave a much needed performance boost, and allowed me to smoothly play games on lower settings.  Since upgrading the processor, the entire system runs much better (though I did have some driver issues with Window's generic drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, but this was eventually solved with AMD's authentic drivers.)  I am now able to play on higher graphics settings.  I suspect an upgraded card with more memory would allow me to run about anything.  It was worth the investment.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Purchased this as a replacement for a failing RX 590, and have been pleasantly surprised with how closely it holds up.Since the build in question was not targeting high end performance in the first place this has made a fair replacement, and it's been able to hold up fairly well in the lighter end and eSports titles that are played on it.For the price at the time of purchase, about $190 in June 2022, it may be worth it to you if you just need something to get up and running while waiting for the next gen or for prices on used hardware to drop more. If you're looking for a long term card with a lot of staying power, I'd recommend skipping the 6500xt lineup and spend the extra for the bump up to the 6600 lineup.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
great price to performance, after a few months using this card ive been playing games at 60fps 1080 without issues with most games (GTAV at 120+fps with high graphics) so yeah its a good enough Card for it price

This card is doing great so far. I spent about $190 dollars on it. It was delivered quickly. I wish AMD sent stickers or posters with it but i havent seen those in awhile. Overall, running 2 monitors at 60 HZ and getting pretty good fps in my games 60-100+ fps. Have not played any really demanding games. From what I understand I can run any of the higher end games if I reduce my settings. I like AMD. I like the prices of their products and they always do well for me. The Adrenaline software is cool. This is not my dream graphics card but I bought it and Its paid for and its serving its purpose with total functionality. In the future I would like to get a Sapphire AMD card like a 6700 XT or maybe one of the new 6750 XTs but honestly for now I am content with this card. I am one that always customizes my in game graphics and so far I would recommend the XFX 6500 XT to anyone in need of a decent card, right now, for a decent price.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

beautiful
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

NVIDIA has ended support for this video card (GT 730) back in October 2021.  They will only provide security updates for this card until Sept 2024.  I had an audio issue with my card using the latest NVIDIA drivers on a Windows 11 computer, but since they are no longer doing bug fixes for this card I have no hope of resolving my audio issues.  I found out about their end of support while troubleshooting my audio issues.  I returned this card and bought two Diamond MM USB to Dual HDMI adapters for $5 less.  The Diamond adapter didn't need any additional drivers installed and both the audio and video work great.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Due to the device not being supported on any driver updates past 473.81, you cannot simply just put this in an existing PC to expand the amount of monitor outs if that PC is using any GPU that requires a newer driver than that, i.e 30 series cards.It's a bummer, they fail to advertise this and it feels like a real missed opportunity, a single slot passive GPU that runs off of mobo power is in theory a great addition to a gaming card, but sadly will simply just not work.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
I got one of these for $50 before the pandemic, to use at my previous job. Two monitors with websites and pos system, and another with security feed. Never a problem, and great picture. I miss it!
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
The first package arrived properly labeled by the manufacturer, but inside was a completely different item. I returned it to Amazon, accepting the 'swap for same' option and held my breath. The next day (!), the correct item arrived. Quick install and works just fine.Very few cards with 4 HDMI ports are available. This one is the least expensive I could fine, and it's driving my multi-monitor setup perfectly.(Be sure to remove the protective cover from the connector first!)

Installed in an old Vostro 410 running Xubuntu 22.04, worked immediately with no ""driver"" issues. Adaptors are driving a VGA monitor, a couple DVI and a HDMI with no problems. No more wasting time switching between 2 computers.

B09VYDTVGY,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B09VYDTVGY,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Good product, with my games FPS are ridiculous
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

Para 1080p, y jugar todo en Ultra a m√°s de 60 FPS, siempre y cuando no est√©s buscando Ray Tracing o streaming. Pura potencia bruta. Es recomendable gestionar manualmente el control de la ventilaci√≥n a trav√©s del software Adrenalin para subir las RPM de los 2 ventiladores. Aunque tenga un ruido medianamente considerable, con aud√≠fonos puestos y jugando, ni se nota. Y as√≠ se mantienen buenas temperaturas en la gr√°fica, ya que la gesti√≥n autom√°tica de la temperatura a trav√©s del software, que trae por defecto, busca m√°s el silencio que el control de la temperatura.

Upgraded from a RX 580 OC and this is completely quiet compared to the 580. Didn't have to uninstall any drivers either, just dropped it in started it up, opened and software, updated it and restarted the pc after. Works great and run cool for the games I use it for.

Great 1080p Graphics card. It has had high framerates as well as a relatively quiet card. Great value with the 2022 GPU surplus. I got this for $250. I am an AMD fan boy and will NOT hand any money over to NVIDA ever again. Its a competent lower mid range graphics card It might be hard pressed to do 4K but then you should be looking at the RX6900 and not here. Overall does what I demand of it and pairs well with my AMD 5000 series board and CPU where i was able to utilize SAM which is a very nice feature.

eficiente la compre para jugar jugar a 1080p y no me ha fallado, excelente rendimiento para los juegos que he usado, entre ellos destiny 2 a full, dark souls 3 full y elden ring medios(iria mejor pero me falta un procesador mas potente actualemente esta con un athlon 3000g con 16gb a 3200mhz)

I cannot complain about this product. If you're an avid gamer who doesn't use high end settings for quality, this is the best option for you. First off, let me state that i am already pro AMD. Secondly, you're only going to get the best preformance from using Adrenalin software and works even better with Amd cpu. Right now my quality is set to high (1330√ó720) max resolution. I've tested a few games but primarily play Warzone. My average fps is 180, top out 336, bottom end 117 (server latency being cause for frame drop, loading screen cause for frame hike) temperature throttles at about 85¬∞ on silent mode. As far as voltage, i have not clocked the mhz due to I do not pay attention to how hungry it is. However, i do not recommend using a 650w psu. If you're wanting preformance at a cheap cost, AMD is a good starting point. My build is NZXT H510 Elite v1, Gigabyte's Aorus x570 I Pro wifi v2, R9 5950x, XPG Gammix s70 Blade 2TB, XPG Spectrix D50 4133mhz, and this xfx speedster 210. I aim to upgrade my mobo and gpu for even better preformance soon.

The XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon RX 6600 CORE (RX-66XL8LFDQ) represents the new low-water mark of what I'll equip any of my non-IGP workstations with.  The last video card that was my min-level choice was an RX580 (8GB).  Essentially, for me, this is a frame buffer that also has some modest video, 3D, codec, and AI acceleration.  Honestly, an RTX3060 would be about the same, but it comes down to price, packaging, and PSU compatibility.  The 2 fan layout (without a comically oversized heatsink) and ability to run on reliably on a 500W PSU are the deal makers for me.  Recommended

This took my pc to the next level. I went from using 560 fx card to this and my frames went up about 25-30 fps on all games. Buy this product!

Flick the switch on the top of the card to the left so it's set to the ""overclock"" profileCopy my settings the picture in adrenalin under performance-tuning to get the best performance out of box. Set the max to 2530 and the minimum to 2430 first, then go up in increments of 20(max 2550), then set the minimum to 100mhz below that(minimum 2450). Setting the target wider than 100mhz can make your fps fluctuate quite a bit(I'm talking 155fps dropping to 80, you can definitely feel it and it doesn't feel good), and less than 100mhz can introduce instability. Next, play your most graphic intensive game(or stress test with furmark or kumbustor) for about 10-15 minutes. Keep adjusting this until it crashes(The screen will go black. Don't panic, it's just resetting your tuning settings to default. You didn't break anything. They're stressed way harder than most know how to during production.) then dial it back to the last stable minimum and max. Some cards can reach 2750, and some can only hit 2600 or less. It's all silicon lottery. The fan curve is up to you; mine is designed to be silent when it can be without compromising performance.Okay, now onto the review. Imagine a world where you could get a GPU that plays most games at 1080p 60fps+ with only a 500w psu required. Now also imagine paying less than $350 for it. Welcome the RX 6600. Scorned by reviewers upon release, it was quickly branded a ""boring"" card because it wasn't built to be a 3060ti(basically a slightly underclocked 3070) competitor and complete 1080ti(although it does beat it in some games) killer. It was built to be a 3060 competitor according to amd, but I could care less about that. How does it game? Well, every title I've tested at 1080p ultra has ran at 60fps or higher outside of a select few. 1440p 60fps is feasible as long as you're willing to compromise a bit on settings. The power draw is fantastic too, with an average of 120w.At the current price point of $300, there's nothing that can match the 6600.

I bought this because my GTX 980 died and i needed a replacement card for gaming, streaming, and VR. I gotta say, this is genuinely fantastic. It fufills all my needs and gets me the gaming performance i need. I absolutely love this. Kinda weird that there is a small white light hidden near the PCIE slot though.

I love it great card for startimg out and on high on all my games 60 +fps all the time my first gaming pc and the intel core i5 12400f and this card with 16 gb ram is what i need for most and all i need for now

I picked this up for my daughters computer, and it's more powerful than my evga FTW3 1080TIOC.  Consumes barely any power as well!

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Decent 30 series under 350. Runs tests and games no problem. Quiet fans.

Graphics are great and I wasn't dissatisfied. Was watching the prices fluctuate and eventually got it for $329+ tax. When I started looking, it was at $430.My previous experience was a nvidia geforce 630 and it blew me away. <insert ""a whole new world""-aladdin>

¬†Meanwhile in the video it sounds, in real life it‚Äôs really half as loud as the mic captures, you won‚Äôt notice it, actually the case‚Äôa fans, are the louder stuff in there. (Recorded while had gpu at 100% and at open case; with closed case it‚Äôs much less)Now that it‚Äôs cheaper really adds value

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing. Este modelo de MSI es excelente, mantiene excelentes temperaturas y hace muy poco ruido, muy recomendado.

Great video card.  Will require at least 500 amp power supply.  I had to add a larger power supply to ensure performance.  I downloaded latest drivers from Gigabyte, My system is Intel i5 processor with 16 gig ram, Windows 10 Pro, self built.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Pros: works without driver to some level , allowing the initial install of my build and eventually full driver installed with no issues within my Windows Server 2012 R2 build with SuperMicro X10Dax. Great value and performance..Cons: pcb is slightly oversized (wider) to the point where the plastic clips built in with my eatx case pcie slot won‚Äôt close fully - had to figure a way around to secure it in place.

I bought a cheap bare bones desktop and of course games on Steam wouldn‚Äôt work right. Super laggy. Put this graphics in and now the games run perfectly. Easy to install too.

Intel on board graphics card was constantly crashing Windows 11. Got this and no more crashes, works for office uses and streaming. Probably will not do for mid to high end gaming,, didn't bother trying.

I thought I could get away an expensive graphics card, but after using this card, I realize there is not enough resources to support serious graphics and gaming. Fortunately it's returnable that's what I did. I purchased a higher end graphics card which I'm satisfied with. Don't get me wrong this graphics card is excellent to run your monitor for browsing, look at pictures, and watching videos but if that's all you gonna do this one's for you.

I installed XUbuntu Linux on a PC with an MSI H67MA-E45 (B3) motherboard.The system was unstable, with Xwindows returning to its logon screen when too many windows were open, specifically when there were too many Firefox tabs open or playing Youtube videos.No matter the BIOS setting, the machine was running out of shared video memory, something that might have been managed by a software driver if the machine was running MS Windows.Based on an Internet search, I found this GT 730 card well reviewed and a reasonably priced solution for an older machine not having a video power connector.The install was easy, and the machine is now stable.  It will never be fast enough for gaming, but works well enough for email and Internet access.

I'm using this for in a PC repurposed for business use, so it's not going to do any gaming. For ordinary business use, it's fine. I'm using the latest NVIDIA driver that I downloaded from their website. I haven't experimented with it much yet, but so far I haven't been able to get it to do 1920x1080 (full HD) resolution. It's a step or two below that. But it works just fine, and I'm pretty happy with this, considering the low price.It's very short, and occupies only one slot. So it will fit easily even in a small computer case. (But not a micro-sized case.) It has one low profile fan. It has signal ports for DVI, VGA, and HDMI. I don't know if it can run two monitors at once; I didn't try that.

Took it up to 2765 MHz GPU, 2400 MHz memory, no problem.  Even at these speeds, I could undervolt from 1.2 to 1.135.  Temps stay below 65C under stress (under 80C Hotpoint).  Returns 19,373 in TimeSpy with a 12400 (as of posting, #1 in the world with this combo, lol).  In my system it's perfect for 4k max settings, easily hitting GPU limits well above my monitor's refresh rate.Good value at current prices.  It doesnt have DLSS or decent raytracing, but even the 3090 can't usually sustain that.  Until then, I think this is the best chip for the money, and a great board as well.FYI, Powercolor has a basic app to change the LED color.  Red wasn't doing it for me, I like white much better.

This card is awesome for my 1440p rig. Paired this GPU with a Ryzen 5800x3D CPU and this setup handles everything on ultra settings with ease. Played BF 2042 ultra settings and I‚Äôm getting about an average of 150 fps stock. I‚Äôve been playing overwatch 2 with max settings and average 240 fps (capped) while overclocked. Tuned my mhz range from 2750 minimum to 2850 maximum and the temps stay below 70c with zero whine.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
As others have reviewed this card did had slight coil whine when I first got it. PowerColor on the box recommends at least a 950W PSU and I only had an EVGA 850W Gold so I upgraded to a EVGA 1000W Platinum PSU and the coil whine went away and is even quieter than my wife's PowerColor 6800XT. This is a heavy card so I highly recommend using the included GPU bracket to prevent card sag long term and PCIE x16 socket stress. I play triple screen 4k games, (75% of 8k resolution) and stock card settings on COD Vanguard with ultra settings, triple 4k, FSR set to ultra quality, I get 85-90 fps with dips down to 75 so it keeps my 70hz 4k monitors well fed. Flight Simulator 2020 gets 22-25fps on high settings triple 4k so enough to fly but not ultra smooth, such a non optimized game. Far cry 5 triple is 45-55 fps on ultra so a bit lower. I should note these numbers are with Smart Access Memory enabled as well. Also for context my CPU is a Ryzen 9 - 5950x. I have found that AMD's eyefinity surround works much better and more consistent than nVidia surround. I did have an EVGA 3070 and had soo many issues with surround, like disabling monitors in windows after leaving surround mode. I like eyefinity's ability to go into surround only when playing games as this is my work-from-home PC so for premier pro, affinity publisher and the like I prefer the normal Windows scaling experience. This card pulls around 289W on stock  settings and temps are decent (70c), enabling extra watts via +20% power makes this card pull 346 watts and gets very warm, (82c-85c). My case is a Thermaltake View 71 (Large Case) and my CPU is on a 360 radiator so there is decent airflow with my additional 5 case fans. I did buy a damaged box card (saved $150 buying from Amazon Warehouse) and the card has been great so far.

Upgrading from a GTX 1070 to this, finally the GPU shortage is done. I have this to play on my new monitor that plays in 4k 160 hz and this beast can perform beautifully.
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
Recieved the wrong GPU at first but that was remedied. Now that I have the card, I can say it works great and is able to do 1440p 144hz on high settings
"
B09VYDTVGY,"
I‚Äôve had the card a few months now. There‚Äôs a few things that have stood out to me.I purchased before the price drops of all the current cards at time of writing, do I feel like I should have waited? Yeah, but I don‚Äôt feel like I was ripped off. This card blows away anything I throw at it.Red devil has a lead to allow the card to the motherboards rgb header, so it matches the motherboard rgb colors for an easier rgb matching.Team red offers a top end gpu with stable drivers, I‚Äôve had less issues with the programs I work with compared to my previous gpu (2080 Super). I don‚Äôt use any driver software such as adrenaline or GeForce now, so that doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me.Overall, great card. Quiet, fast, handles everything I throw at it at 4K or 1440 ultra wide.

Best video card you can get for $799.  Screams through all games, and even FS 2020 cannot stop it.The build quality is excellent, and it even comes with a brace / support bracket for the card.

I chose this one instead of 3080 (I had FE before ) and i'm happy with it1440p nice performance, I love Radeon chill feature and Adrenalin dashboard. Build quality is really nice.

Aside from the amazing performance, this cards construction is impeccable. It's built like a tank. The back plate and fan shroud are heavy metal and worthy of being considered artwork. I wont even get into the benchmark numbers other than to say they are impressive. Top tier to say the least. My build consists of an x570 Aorus Xtreme rev 1.1, Ryzen 9 5950x, Aorus 360mm aio, G.Skill F43600C14-16GTZN 32gb, Sabrent 1tb Rocket 4 Plus, EVGA supernova 1000w Gold+ PSU, and of course Powercolor Red Devil 6950 xt. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to use my uphere graphics card bracket as it supports the card very well and adds much needed rgb under the card instead of sudden darkness. Even under extreme loads for sustained periods of time the thermal solution keeps things cool and quiet.All this is wrapped up in a Phantexs Full tower case. It's a work station but I play games on it as well. Now I can do both even better. The one and only thing I wish they had done was put the rgb Red Devil Logo on the front edge like they did on the 5700xt. Otherwise my review is 100% 5 star. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants top of the line performance and great value.
