I stumbled on this pc while looking for parts to build a new computer. The price of this thing is a steal at 1100 dollars. 11th gen I7, 3060ti, water-cooled. It was a great deal. So, after it arrived, I've been playing on it for over 2 weeks. It has been running beautifully, it plays Elden Ring on Ultra just fine, Cyberpunk on high settings at a consistent 60fps, and Overwatch 2 on ultra (I play on 1080p not 4k, keep that in mind). My cpu temps run just fine as well, it averages around 50c with a workload on it and gpu temps are around 60c. Max I've seen them run is 70c but I went into MSI Center and ramped my fans up to 100% and they lowered quite a bit. Now, the downfall of this pc is the RAM. I was promised 16gb of 3200mhz ram. It currently sits at 2667mhz as I am typing this. My friend has this exact PC and his runs at 3200. So I'm not sure what's going on here but my RAM is definitely off. I have ordered 32gb of 3200mhz that is on the way. Which I planned on upgrading the ram anyway, but i had to buy 4 sticks instead of 2 sticks. Also, I do not trust this water-cooler or Power supply. Both are off brand and I plan on replacing them before they go out. I know I have said some pretty big cons in this review, however, I think this is a great pc so far. It hasn't let me down yet, the m.2 is fast as hell. I really like it, but I do plan on making upgrades to it soon for longevity and efficiency.

UPDATE: Support did get back to me and in the process of getting information about the RAM modules, they are not both working and I have the advertised 16gb. I've updated the rating to four stars because support was still quite slow to get back to me and there wasn't a quicker, more direct way to contact them. The computer works as intended now and the damaged case isn't the manufacturer's fault.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived with some cosmetic damage to the top front of the case. This isn't the seller/manufacturer's fault but certainly worth noting. It runs fine and has a lot of performance for the money. The reason it gets one star is because Windows is only reporting 8gb of RAM, and it's supposed to have 16. I checked to make sure both sticks are seated but still only showing 8gb. I contacted support through the only method possible - a form on their website. I've heard nothing back besides the automated reply. It's been five days. I am also unable to register it because it seems like the model is discontinued and the model isn't an option on the registration form. Overall the computer is fine, notwithstanding defective RAM. However, five days and no reply after I've received a defective product is unacceptable and I cannot recommend this  computer based on that alone.

Zotac may not be the top brand but their pre-builts are amazing. I got this on sale for 1,100. At this time a 3060 ti/AIO/ 1TB SSD/a good i7 processor/motherboard with room to upgrade. This is amazing. Spent months looking at pre builds...none of the top brands gave you this much for 1.1k anything close to this is 1.3k without AIO and 500gb ssd.. and a cheaper processor and motherboard. The build is a little loud but good temps and that Zotac 3060 TI is a champ. If you see this build for 1.1k or less again BUY IT you won't find a better deal. Also this is 100% plug and play it's all ready to go üëç

Bought this lovely piece of hardware with Amazon's payment plan, and I'm  VERY glad for that. After the first payment, they send you the product, and you pay in monthly parts. THAT BEING SAID, This card is great for what I need. I've been creating 3D assets, VRchat Worlds, and VRchat Avatars, along with more Digital Artwork, and it's been able to handle it beautifully. Not to mention being able to finally play newer PC games, which is a plus.

I got this at a huge discount (1200) but it wouldn't be worth it at full price. AIO was scuffed up which had me worried CPU was damaged and wouldn't even boot but it did, one of the fans on AIO radiator has a decent wobble to it. One of the display port connections in the graphics card is extremely temperamental and goes off for like no reason at all.Aside from that, its starts, runs and operates like anything you could ever expect out of a base model gaming computer.

I'm not a bleeding-edge enthusiast, but I love seeing the best in my games. I upgraded from a GTX 1050, and this card has let me max-out my settings without breaking the bank!Games that run great at 1080p, 60hz, max settings:-Control-Cyberpunk 2077-Doom: Eternal-Elden Ring-Outriders-RDR2Overall, a great card for modern gaming. It'll be a long time before I'll be needing another upgrade.

¬†Bought this 3060 about 4 months ago and haven't had a single problem with it. Looks good. Performs great for its tier. Fans are loud at 100% but that makes sense. Now as far as over clocking. I've been able to go up to 160 on the core and haven't tried anything higher than 1000 on the memory. It was stable on almost all of my games other than Warzone. So I brought it down to 150 on the core and 800 on the memory and haven't had one game crash sense. I'm very impressed with this card. To be fair I didn't leave it at this high of an overclock. I just wanted to see where it would be stable. I currently run it all the time at 120 core and 500 memory with custom fan curve. It never gets above 63c and in gaming never gets over 58c. Zotac will be my number one choice for GPUs from here on out.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
Great graphics card i have been using zotac for 5 years and it never lets me down.  Make sure you download a software to make gpu fans run faster so temperatures are not high.  If you know how to modify fans i suggest to do it so you wont kill this gpu in a year.  This is a special kind of gpu with 12gb it can play anything just make sure you have good ventilation in your case.
"
B08W8DGK3X,"
This gpu works great, tho the couple problems I have are the fan noise level when it turns on, the warm plastic smell still comes and goes and the metal rack on the back came bent so I couldn't properly screw it in (had to diy it). The last one is probably my biggest issue. I bought it new but tbh I'd expect nothing less from something ""made in China"" sadly.

I got this for my wife. She uses her i7-12700K based machine mostly for rendering still images, so this is just what I thought was an adequate card which is below the steep part of the price performance curve. After building the machine I ran the Passmark tests and was surprised to find that this has substantially better 2D performance (1255) than my RTX3070 (943), 3D performance for the 1660 Super was 14,168 compared to 24,787 for the RTX3070. Considering she mostly needs 2D and I mostly need 3D I guess we both got what we needed.While testing and installing software I ran a 3440x1440 144Hz monitor on Display Port and a 3840x2160 TV on HDMI and both looked good. No signs of the card running out of performance or bandwidth. On an old GTX980 the fast monitor gave color fringes until I turned it down to 60Hz.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this card again for any normal PC. Unless you are playing very high resolution 3D games it should do everything you want.

I got this little guy when my old, reliable 980ti finally kicked the bucket....during the COVID chip shortage, of course. I was a little marked up but, still affordable. I was shocked at how well the Super performed and how close in numbers it was to the TI version. For affordable gaming, you can't beat this little beast.
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
This is a good graphics card it‚Äôs an excellent GPU I was getting 140 fps in a big game but when I bought it was over 500$ when the market was high that‚Äôs really the only thing I can complain about So of your Looking for a good GPU this one is really good.

package arrived with no damage opened box and installed this 1660 Super in my wifes gaming desktop(one of wally world specials) had a little problem getting the connectors to hook up to the power. other then that PC saw video card i went to Nvidias website and played GTA. and  immediately saw a BIG diffrence in the graphics. also tested RDR2  the ONE game she couldnt play thanks to HP!  loaded that up and my wife was very happy. thought Video card was gonna be bigger but it fitWOULD  order from this seller again.
"

This card is the top of the line for the technology I had available in my case. I can play all the games I have currently at full settings and with no issues. Excellent card if you have slightly older motherboard and processor.

My goal was being able to play the newer games on my Dell, more specifically, FC4.  I had bought the RX 570 which did a great job, but for some reason, it was extremely noisy.  It made a loud whirring sound every time I played the game.  The other games I've played, Fallout 3 and 4, Crysis, the card didn't make those horrible sounds.  Realizing the cost of gpu's are rapidly escalating, I checked out the GTX 1660 Super.  I checked it with games-debate and it was superior to the RX 570.  The frame rates are incredible!  Also, a BIG plus was the small size of the card.  I already had an 8 pin adapter to plug it in and it installed super easy and ran like a dream.  The temperature of the card runs within the norm and has made an incredible difference in game play.  I highly, VERY highly recommend this card!  It's a good price for the card and it delivers exceptional performance if you're unable to get the higher end gpu's.  It's worth the price!
"
B07Z8PWC6R,"
I am using a Ryzen 5 1600 paired with a 660ti so this upgrade for me was very substantial and really the cheapest way to break into ultra settings with 60+ FPS (usually above 75fps even in modern games like borderlands 3) which is perfect since I have a 1080p monitor with a 75hz refresh rate. Anything stronger than this card would yield better results but, would probably be bottlnecked past a rtx 2060 or 2060s which is the next price bracket above this card. So this really works well with the 2016 released Ryzen 5 I‚Äôm using. I think at the $249 I paid in about June of 2020 was very fair and I have been very happy with it overall. If you have more money get an RTX 2060s but at $250 or slightly under this is a great option. This card is small so it‚Äôll fit in to many cases, not quite a low profile but smaller than some single fan designs I‚Äôve seen. For its size it also weighs more than I‚Äôd expect it to eluding to a nice heat sink. Overall the thermals are not bad and I have overclocked it utilizing the OC feature on MSI afterburner and now my clock speed is around 1700 and boosts up a little past 2000 which is actually pretty great for just using the stock cooler. It isn‚Äôt very loud and I do have an open case design so I would be able to quickly tell. I like that the card is simple because some look obnoxious but, I would have liked even just a simple clean backplate especially since I‚Äôve seen cheaper 1650 cards with backplates for $100 less than this card.

It's a decent GPU but I overpaid for it because of the GPU shortage at the time. Those things aren't really my issue though. My issue is the oversized cooler that has a small RGB logo in proportion to its size. The ""Selling feature"" of the RGB fans should have been left out for a better designed RGB on the side. None of that is as bad as the terrible software that is required to control the color of the lights, Gigabyte RGB Fusion. Its better just to turn off the LEDs unless you purchased all Gigabyte/Aorus parts. I still thoroughly enjoy this GPU but don't buy it for the RGB
"
B09719T6FT,"
This product is computer compensation and is mainly used for standard level gaming such as GTA V, COD, Apex Legends, etc. and will run these games at the max as long as the CPU is good as well. For the value it‚Äôs amazing I say the price of it is good especially for inflation and what it was before. The noise level isn‚Äôt something of worry it‚Äôs just as loud as normal fan within the computer. When installing ensure you push the sides of the PCIE slot, no need to get aggressive with it, this is sensitive so if the bottom part breaks the whole components is deemed useless.
"
B09719T6FT,"
This card is much bigger than my GTX 1070 so make sure your case has room. I was able to get this in but it was tight. The card is awesome and the price was right for $400.

What I like the most is that Amazon financed it for me! didn't have to sell my kidney to buy a modern graphics card to replace my 1050ti which, to be fair was just as good without all the new ray tracing and cuda cores I needed for work these days..  So a RTX card was necessary.For games my old card was fine, never needed to run anything on 4k on ultra settings, it handled 4k on high settings just fine.But anyway, the new card really does shine at handling my work projects with better than satisfactory performance.  The actual graphics memory shows up as a whopping 44 gigs total, with 12 physical.  I don't even know why fully, its something to do with the rest of the build i guess.  (Threadripper with 64 gigs ram and about 15 TB total in drives)All I know is that it handles actual work and not just video games, otherwise I would've went with the 8gig cards, could've ended up spending twice as much on a 3080 and judging by the fact I can't get this thing below 30fps on any game I threw at it so far, this card was the best choice for both work and completely wasting my time playing games lol.It arrived pristine and brand spankin new in the wrap, so props to the seller and it mounted up and has been whisper quiet in there while handling everything I can throw at it.  The only other card I would've bought would have been the 3090 but honestly its way too close to the 4000 series coming out to blow two grand on something that's so soon to be another paperweight in comparison.  Ill take the 4000 series for 2k, at least I'll be on the bleeding edge when I do.Especially if Amazon finances it for me lol.  Anyone need a spare kidney?

I'm so glad prices of these GPUs are finally going down! Finally upgraded from a 1070 to a 3060.It arrived in 2 days, plugged it all in, and started working right away. FPS in games have gone up significantly. Most games I didn't have an issue FPS wise anyways. But it was time to upgrade, and these GPU prices were crazy the past few years. Definitely a worth upgrading for gaming and/or editing!

First off, a great card for the money even with the inflated prices. the surprises i mention are that it comes with no Manual or cables. NONE. all you get is a warranty card, badge, quick guide which is no help at all and the video card....thats it. No fault of the seller. This is an ""Elite"" series of the card which im assuming they know what you are doing(which I do) but for a novice it would be slightly difficult. if you do a lil google research you can have this card up and going in 20 minutes. Also upgraded from a GTX 1060 and am blown away
"
B09719T6FT,"
What can I say about this card that hasn't already been said? Was definitely worried about choking the fans with the half inch gap between the PSU shroud (Lian LI lancool 205m) but the card keeps up and I have yet to see above 70¬∞c! 1080p on most games I play (Destiny 2, warzone, PUBG, Forza, gta5, etc) are well above the 120fps mark with some in the 200s.
"
B09719T6FT,"
Part works and everything. But the product key for the part has already been used so I can't register my gpu for a 4 year warranty that comes with it. Now I have to contact customer service to address the issue
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
Nothing wrong with this GPU, it‚Äôs cheap and effective. Definitely does mostly everything you will ever need it to do and well! That being said the 3060 being roughly 90 dollars more is well worth the extra price, from performance to capabilities.

It‚Äôs great quality, but what can I say, it‚Äôs an rtx 3050 very powerful great price.
"
B09QVPMGYV,"
It is SUPER quiet even under heavy loads and I was really impressed by the graphics quality.  Oat reviews I saw said that it was great at 1080p but I played DCS in 4k with no problems and it looked fantastic! I did end up returning it tho but only because I found a great deal on a 3060 and it only made sense to upgrade. I definitely recommend this card for someone building an above average PC. You won't be disappointed.

Unlike most people, I purchased this to convert videos files, not gaming. It's blazing fast at converting video files from h.264 to h.265 CoDecs.I have an Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E GAMING motherboard + Intel Core i7-8700 Coffee Lake 8th Gen 6-core 12-thread 3.2GHz (4.6GHz Turbo) + Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 3.2GHz DDR4 RAM.I was using the CPUs built-in H.264 and H.265 hardware acceleration to covert videos.On average, it would convert video recorded with the following at about 5 to 10 frames per second.Video Stream: 720p (1280x720), 2925kbps, 29.97FPS, AVC (Main@L3.1) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames)Audio Stream: 184kbps, 44.1kHz, 2 channels, AAC LCAfter adding this video adapter, I can now convert the same videos at an average of 1400 frames per second. That's over 140% faster!

For those familiar with Gigabyte, the quality of this card is exactly what you would expect.  This is the entry level RTX 3050 chipset, but Gigabyte allows you to overclock the card slightly for tweaking performance.  RGB Fusion lights up the GIGABYTE name on the card in your choice of colors, but perhaps the nicest feature is displaying a thermal value related color.  A cool green represents comfy temps, while yellows and oranges represent increasing heat values.  Installation is super simple and requires an open PCIE power connection on your PSU.  (cable not included).  A great value for the money!

Overall great card if you are not interested in RTX performance (ray tracing). I was skeptical buying this brand again after getting a DOA AMD 550 a year or so ago during the great video card shortage. I was also concerned over getting a refurbished mining card. However, the box seemed intact and the card itself looked new without any dust or dirt anywhere to be seen on the card itself or cooling system.I have the 6800xt mated with an AMD 5600x, an X570 Aorus mobo (capable of enabling SAM), and 32gb of AMD optimized RAM. My primary display is a 4k 120Mhz OLED 65‚Äô TV. So far I am able to max out all settings in 4k with frames ranging from dips to the mid 40s to maxing out my display at 120fps. On average, I been getting 60-80 fps.The card does run hot (look for JUNCT temp). I have to set my fan speeds aggressively both with my case and GPU. The fans on the Red Dragon are loud when running above 50% speed or so (especially as you go over 65%). There is a bios switch on the Red Dragon that allows for underclocked ‚Äúsilent‚Äù running‚Ä¶ without that enabled (or a waterblock installed) expect a decent amount of fan noise and heat as you push your GPU in most modern games at 4k.While the card does have RTX cores, turning on full ray tracing in games like Dying Light 2 and Cyberpunk 2022 at 4k is, personally, unplayable. However, the RTX cores are nice to have and maybe some performance can be salvaged from them with future driver optimizations and games partnered with AMD tech.I am happy with my purchase as maxing out my settings at 4k with frames 60fps or higher without spending any more then necessary was my goal. Giving up RTX performance was always on the chopping block for me given the outrageous mark up on the 6800xt/3080 + level cards lately. Things look even worse with NVIDA‚Äôs new 4000 series cards with unprecedented MSRPS for both their 4080s and 4090s. Call me old fashioned but paying $600-$800 is an already healthy markup on said models, trying to keep the crypto prices alive is beyond greedy.Amazon giving me a 5 months interest free option @$614 on this GPU was the magic number combo for me.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Pros:* Compared to 3080, this delivers similar performance and better $/FPS.* Got it around 09/2022 when price started to drop. Sure it will be cheaper if you wait more but it's good bang for the buck if you can't wait.* Been rocking a 1080 for 5 yrs, good to see AMD coming a long way for their video card. AMD Adrenaline is easy to use, with integrated OC ability.Cons:* At this point I'm still not sure if I got an open box. There's seal on the box but none on the antistatic bag. And there's nothing in the case other than a simple business card sized guide directing you to powercolor website.* 3 fans can be loud, but understandable.* Card is long and doesn't fit nicely on my PCIE support bracket.

B08V1WK4LB,"
I have been using this for a month now and use the silent BIOS. I can play FF7 remake and Elden ring on ultra settings at 1440p and the fans DON'T EVEN TURN ON! The card will stay under 58c in most games and I have never seen it get above 68c yet with more demanding titles like MW2 campaign. More demanding titles will generate some significant coil wine as others have mentioned but I game with headphones so it's not audible at all. For $550 I could not have done better.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Good performance, Price was 589 when I got it and that was a reasonable decent deal.The temps are nice and low. I threw everything I could at it while its on its OC bios and it couldnt go up higher than 75cI am for sure a fan of powercolor GPUs, they have always been very solid, and well made. Whenever its time again for me to buy a GPU again it will most likely be powercolor or sapphireI did not experience any coil whine, however, the fans are nothing to write home about, average to louder than average noise level for the level of air moved.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
I got this at a decent value at the time, they are even cheaper now as of this review. Its performance is great. I do mostly 1080 gaming on 3 widescreen curve monitors. Never dips below 120 frames on max for any game I throw at it. Paired with a 5600x on mini itx aorus. Switched from nvidia as I dont like their practices anymore and im very pleased with the results. Not just the performance but driver compatibility. No more graphical tears, glitches, flickers, missing textures that seemed to plague my old 2070 ti.Its very noisey. Makes a buzz noise at higher fps which I found out is normal for some cards. In a case its barely noticeable, but open case it was too much to tolerate. In a normal case it gets toasty. Im sure it thermal throttles a lot in closed case but i havnt notice as 1080 isnt pushing it too hard.

B08V1WK4LB,"
This card makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 silky smooth at high detail settings in 1440p averaging 100FPS.  Just what I needed from a graphics card.The price is right @ ~ $600 as of Oct 2022.Card runs quiet and cool.  Great buy.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
This card has it, the cooler and fans are more than adequate to keep the card quite but unfortunately the card received has some pretty terrible coil whine when under load.  I will continue to use the card for the next few days and report back if burn in helps dampen the noise.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Gets a pretty good score in 3dMark, but im glad i paired it with a 5900x. Star citizen runs great now. The 6600xt is okay, but this is the highest end gpu ive ever used in a personal system and i can feel it. BE WARNED, it pumps out ALOT OF HEAT. Mainly from the psu because this thing is power hungry. So if youre in a heat wave like indiana is rn, and you dont have central air, your window unit probably wont keep up. All in all, good value for gaming but mining performance is sub par. Only makes about a Dollar and a half a day on nicehash. Maybe thats good, but its not worth the extra heat to me, even when im not home.
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Got it on sale or else GPU are still expensive. I love Powercolor GPU, I had a RX580 which was way nosier than this one. It‚Äôs working great and great performance so far. Love the zero rpm during low power usage
"
B08V1WK4LB,"
Looks great, works great, runs Escape from tarkov at max settings w/ over 100 fps. 5900x cpu. Only complaint is the coil whirs/whines audibly. It's not very loud, but I couldn't handle it without headphones. Luckily I don't hear it with my headset on. 4 stars because of noise.

Scored this GPU as a ""Good"" Amazon Warehouse item and the packaging was perfect, card was in its static back, and works perfectly. The 6800 completed my all-AMD build as it's matched with a Ryzen 7 5700X to take advantage of the smart access memory feature.

This is a very well built card that has great thermals. The msrp is not $579 as another misinformed reviwer had said. This has been $819.99 from day one directly from Asus. So although prices are high, not nearly as bad as that would lead one to believe. Overall this performs exceptionally at 2k resolution, and also doesn't do terribly at high/medium settings in 4k either. It's not the fastest card out but when priced right and having some OC headroom can be one of the better values in this current market.

B08P3YT3MY,"
MSRP is $579.00

The gpu is sturdy with full metal body except the fans. Feels and looks premium. You can check out performance figures online and the card lives up to it. The card is a bit heavier than usual.There‚Äôs some glitch with rgb control software which switches off the TUF logo led sometimes and needs manual reset from armoury crate. I faced this a couple of times and this somehow fixed itself.The recommended power supply is 750W so make sure you have enough headroom. I have not seen this card draw more than 250-270W at full load.I have clocked at least 30 hours on this card at full load with 4 hours continuous game play. I have not encountered any os or game crashes.I switched to this from Nvidia card and did not face any issues with DDU default settings for removing the Nvidia drivers. Also, I am running a CPU without integrated graphics and the display works without amd drivers installed.This is a solid product and a recommended buy.

Double-check the dimensions of the space for this card as it's a wide one. The original computer I wanted to put it in was narrower than the entire case, much less the space inside. Thankfully, I had an old backup from 2013 that it works very well in.

This card performs so well. I played Halo Infinite on it with all settings turned up to ULTRA and it runs butter smooth. This is not supposed to be possible for this card according to IGN, a famous computer games web site. They say you need a 3080 Ti to do that, but I did it with this 3060 OC and got butter-smooth graphics. However, I do have an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU, which they say is also required to play Halo Infinite with all settings to ultra. Nonetheless, I did it with this card and it was perfect. I can't tell you what performance you will get with it, since that partly depends on the performance of your CPU, memory, and motherboard. I am highly impressed with what I have. This card is wonderful for the price. Cards with significantly higher performance are twice to three times the price of this one. For me, it's a no-brainer to not throw out tons of money when I can have this one and get great performance in the same game. The enormous cooler keeps the card running comfy cool too.

Had to wait about an extra year than I wanted to, but after thre price came down to MSRP I pulled the trigger and haven‚Äôt looked back.Came from a 1660 super so it was a substantial upgrade in performance.Went from 40-60 frames to 138-150 frames for Warzone
"
B08WTFG5BX,"
Works good, although I had some issues today where I couldn't get it to work for a bit. Thought it died on me. Had to plug into my MB graphocs port and after that things turned on. Plugged back into this GPU after that and everything was working right again. Not sure what happened but if it turns out to be a bad GPU, I'll edit this post. Would,'ve been a 5 star rating if noy for this issue.

Bought this card for $429.99 (sold and sent by Amazon) and it is incredible. The triple fan configuration makes cooling a little easier. It can handle heavy games with maxed-out settings at 1080p easily and if you add DLSS you can get 100+ FPS in pretty much every game.The price is still high based on its MSRP, but $429.99 it's way better than paying $600+ for it.It can handle 1440p but it really shines at 1080p. If you want a bit more power, you can go with the TI variant if you find it for a really good deal, which is pretty damn hard.

Used it for my wife's all white build. There is no RGB, just white light on the Zotac Gaming. Looks good and kills 1080p gaming. Wife is getting 200+ FPS in R6 Siege, and around 70 in Shadow of The Tomb Raider, on high.

This card sealed in package from 1 year ago, how is it miners causing price increase if these cards never been in a mining rig?  Finally bought one but scalpers and human nature is why prices are up, these guys don't even know how to mine or they would never sell the cards. rofl.normies gonna norm, but prices aren't going down even with the low hash rate variants so naturally its the same as consoles just being overpriced so that children can't play games.  sad.

¬†At first I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 1,000 bucks for this card. But having just got scammed out 800 bucks for a rtx 2070. I can say I‚Äôm glad I got scammed, and ended up with this beast. It always handles everything I throw at it (not even overclocked). The thing looks like a sexy motherfacker and fits my white theme perfectly (as seen in pictures and videos). Honestly perfect for what I use it for, never had a problem (owned for 10 months now, so yes I payed 1,000 during the pandemic as this was ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at the time) 10/10!!

I bought it, and it works- upgraded my cpu with it and runs flawlessly.

This card is nice. The vented backplate helps it run cool and the added dash of RGB is not overdone or trying to be extra fancy. It's not overclocked as much as other manufacturers and runs cooler because of it but it can easily be done.

Seems most brands for the NVidia GPU are about the same, with small variations in over-clock, construction and fans. This one doesn't have a lot of RGB LED going on, just the Gigabyte logo. I got it as an Amazon warehouse ""used"" so less than typical retail pricing. It came in good shape and no issues with installation. I know not everyone has, but I've had pretty good luck with the Amazon warehouse deals.At this point in time (fall 2022), maybe waiting for the new AMD RDNA 3 reviews would be worthwhile. But if you need a GPU now, this is a safe bet and a good paring with the Intel i7-12700 CPU.
"
B098Q4M4WH,"
Don't want to accidentally burn down your house? Don't go for the 4000 series graphics cards and stick with 3000. (Seriously, the melting cables is concerning to me). This card has nearly all games on max with 100+ fps on a 38"" monitor. I couldn't be happier. I bought another for my wife.

As a famous pirate had once said....Hello Beastie...And certainly a beast it is, this card blew my 1660 super out of the water no doubt about that, it has chewed up every single game I had thrown at it, full graphics 1080p or 1440 no problems.....now I haven't really done enough testing since I only had it for like a day, however I can certainly see a difference....and I might even be bottlenecking it too since my hardware is already on the older side, or weaker...Ryzen 5 3600DDR 4 16gb 3000mhzMsi gaming plus b450 moboYeah I'm pretty sure there is some bottlenecking but so far I haven't really noticed, price was good although not quite exact, rtx 3070 at MSRP usually fetch for 499 or 550 but I got mine at $599, not totally unreasonable but I couldn't pass up the deal it was the best I was gonna get, try looking for an rtx 3070 for lower than $650 (if you're lucky) I dare you....most of the 3070s you'll see here are around 700 and above and possibly weaker (friggin scalpers)....If you are worried about LHR, just don't, that's really only meant to reduce performance for crypto-asshats, if you are going to use it for gaming you have absolutely nothing to worry about because the performance will be there....Overall, I think there might be a shining light for us gamers as we move further ahead, my advice stay patient and be on the lookout, NEVER buy from scalpers....and if you're lucky and find a good deal, don't pass it up just grit your teeth and buy it......

Bought for warzone here are my thoughts on it. It was definitely an improvement but not quite as much as I hoped. Wanted 120 frames highest setting and I get about 90 consistent.  Some of this may be bottle necked through my i7 processor however idk thinking it's more of the fact there wasn't enough graphics card memory for all the shaders the game requires. Overall I'd say 4 stars not the best but you'll be running your games rather smoothly

I upgraded from the XFX RX 580 Black Edition. While that card held its own for about 5 years... This 3070ti blows it away. I was having slight temperature increases, up to about 80 F. Now, I max out around 65. Wow, just wow. The whole computer is running SOOO much better. I know the price point is incredibly steep, but just do it. It will be well worth it. I did have to upgrade the power supply from a 550w to a 750w. Mostly, for the PCI-E 8 pin connections, the 3070ti requires 3 separate 8 pin connections. Just for reference my build is, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gb DDR4 3000 mhz, Gigabyte Aorus Ultra X570. Also, I bought the ROG Herculx Stand for extra support. The RGB looks amazing but, the stand is not necessary. The motherboard more than supports this hefty card. JUST BUY IT!!!!
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
this is a great card even going from a 2060 super to this I got 60-80 more fps in most tittles with the same graphics settings. Playing most of everything in 2 k with high settings and hitting my 144hz refresh limit. butter smooth and pushes out fps with out pulling out too much wattage. only down side was getting the power connected correctly. Oh and temps are amazing never seen it go past 65 c even with big OCs.

After a couple months of use, I can run any game I have installed at 1080p and highest settings. Once I get a 1440p monitor I will update this review with results. Top tier GPU, will run anything.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
The Asus card has good cooling and decent aesthetics, even if they are a bit juvenile in my opinion. But the exaggerated price for essentially strix name and extra plastic just don't justify the end product. The 3070 TI just does not come close enough to the 3080 to justify its existence therefore I would suggest holding off for a 3080 or sticking with a 3070 because this really does not offer anything over either one of those classes except a bloated price point.

Upgrading from a 2070 RTX Super. What a difference. I live stream video games and it has made such a difference in not just what I see, but what my viewers see. The one thing you need to be aware of is that this thing is huge! I had to buy a different case. Be sure to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit (use the website to make sure of fit and compatibility). Price was much lower than they had been, but still a little high.
"
B096YQ6WVW,"
I typically go for and msi GPU when I‚Äôm looking to upgrade, but The Asus ROG design for the 30 series cards look absolutely stunning, the RGB is very smooth with plenty of options on the software. I have done several benchmarks and the card has not gone over 70 Celsius, and stays quiet even at that temperature. This card stays cool even in a case like mine that is considered to have poor airflow. I would say if your looking for a 3070 ti, get the ROG card, however the ROG card consumes more power than other models (3 8-pin) also, I don‚Äôt think this is a significant enough upgrade from the 3070, if you have a 3070 now and you want to upgrade to for a 3080 or 3080ti. Overall this is a great card for the price.

RTX 3060 Ti at $490.00 in 2022-09.I love MSI and have always found their cards to strike a great balance between power and efficiency. This one though, my first GPU upgrade since pre-pandemic, is really on the line. It is possible I do not know what I am talking about and that all the cards coming out now are power-hungry behemoths, but based on the fact that I had to dig out auxiliary power cables for my modular (650W) PSU and remove a case fan to get this thing in...I also take issue, as a multi-monitor user, with its weird spread of 1 HDMI + 3 DisplayPort. Maybe that's standard now? I have been living under a COVID-shaped rock. But it works! (Although for some reason it makes the middle DisplayPort the primary monitor...)On the positive side though, the card works just fine for gaming. It's quiet (although I also run MSI Afterburner), runs whatever I throw at it at 1080p without a hiccup, and enables ray tracing which for me is a big upgrade. I really wish the card was a little smaller and used a little less power, but-- I finally got a new video card!

I had to upgrade for work and once i saw an option to buy a used RTX 3060 Ti  came up i had to get it.IT took a while to ship, but the card is amazing and easy to install.Took very little time to install the drivers and update.Thank you so much!!!

Was building a gaming pc back in April, back when some components were still at higher prices then currently. Paid $699 for the item plus taxes. Went from a laptop with a 970 graphics card to this was a complete game changer. Easy installing on my PC and doesn't make as much noise. Provides great frame rates for games I currently play. Now that prices are dropping this one is now a good choice to select for PC gaming builders and has also been recommended on popular YouTubers building PCs with 3060ti.
"
B0995TBTLS,"
It‚Äôs a 3060 ti but it‚Äôs almost 90 dollars more expensive than what you can get for a $400 founders edition 3060 ti. The RGB is a little redundant in my opinion. Other than that, solid performance, cooling, and noise level.

It runs all of my emulators very well at a consistent 60fps. If you‚Äôre into PCSX2, RPCS3, Dolphin, etc. THIS CARD is perfect for you and your wallet. It‚Äôs works great with my Ryzen 9 CPU chip. I recommend this product to anyone who is a heavy gamer and refuses to have crashes or frame drops on games like League of legends, CS:GO, or any competitive game. I have nothing but great things to say about this and thank Amazon for giving the best price out of the bunch. (I did my personal pricing research, Amazon was the cheapest on the market.) Due to my experience, i was gaming on an intergrated AMD GPU for years and it was rocky tweaking and re-configuring my computer to the best of my ability. But this saved me the hassle. I love it and haven‚Äôt gotten off my computer on my free time since.
"

After weeks of research this set up stood out among all the other ""gaming pc"" listings. They put a lot of care and effort into providing a quality product, very professionally packaged, thorough documentation, brand new PC. Specs looked great, off-Amazon reviews bolstered confidence, all the others had at least one review that made me doubtful. This one did not disappoint. Easy set up, fast connection, has not had any problems with any game. Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite, Halo, it's a whole new world for a 12 year old gamer kid upgrading from something not built specifically for gaming. Cool lights, plenty of fans, easy access for upgrading in the future though we've been using it as it came with zero issues. Nothing else in this price range looked like it would even come close. Very happy kid.

Dell 5680, 48 GIGS SSDR4 Ram, 2400 hz. Replaced a GTX 1060 with this RTX 3050.  To Install. Restart your Dell 5680 In BIOS, by pressing F2. In Boot Disable Secure Boot. Enable Legacy Rom On. Press your power button after the screen goes black. (because the screen will go black and stay there, don't worry) . Hold it until the machine shuts down. Remove the power plug, remove all attached cables in the rear of the machine. (take a picture, so you know how they go back). Remove left cover,  remove the old GPU Card. Install the new RTX 3050 into the GPU slot. Power on with just Keyboard, Mouse attached.  Boot will take about 7 minuets. don't worry, it will boot.  After that you'll see the new card in Device Manager. After that Shut down again, and put your cables back where they belong. Restart again this may take time.  When your machine is ready at desktop. Do a restart and then your done...;

When I bought the zotac 3050 it is definitely a good bang for your buck. The next tier up is. 3060 and the cheapest one at the time was well over 100$ more.  This 3050 is still amazing with 8gb VRAM which is more than you'll ever need lol. Ok overclocking and the design is ok 8(6+2) power cord. I'm using a atx mid tower case and never hear it while gaming with max fan speeds.

My case was a bit of a tight fit, but I got it installed and my tower back together.Cooling seems reasonably effective - it didn't get abnormally warm when run at full benchmark.  Also no noise at all when the fan speed ramped up a bit.What I noticed was that performance was a bit inconsistent.  The Valley and Heaven benchmark tests ran at 120fps or greater at full 4k; but a game like Final Fantasy VII: Episode Sephiroth was struggling to reach 60fps at that same 4k.  This tells me that I'm now dealing with poorly optimized games.  But based on the benchmark it's a significantly more powerful card at a very reasonable price point.

¬†If you snatch this card I say pull the trigger. I came from a loud noisy 5700xt that idled at 50c yes 50c. From my testing in stock config this card idles at around 38-40c and when gaming stock, never reaches over 66c (mind you I have this card vertically mounted in a h510 elite so your Temps should probably be better lol) it's quiet, fast and cool. With a nice little OC (+110 on core and +1000 Mem freq) and upping power limit 10% I was seeing perf increases of 10-20 fps in games like Hell let lose, car X, Ground Branch and Battlefield 2042 on high settings at 1440p no DLSS. The RGB is unique on this card when vertically mounted it looks incredible. Build quality is decent with a metal backplate but it made some questionable creeks to the plastic while mounting it so just be careful. Overall this card will not disappoint if your looking for exceptional 1440p performance at high frames, just keep in mind this card barely fit in my h510 elite with a 280 mm AIO so be cautious for smaller cases. Cheers.

This board is pretty good.  Not good for the price, but what is at this point.  Its OK for any gaming I would do, but I really do not do any.  I do run solid works, edit photographs and maybe encode video from time to time.  And it is much slower at all these things than a $1500 board, but it is about $320.  It is much better at these things than the 10900K processor build in graphics, so I'm happy enough.  It arrived in perfect conditions and while I have not attempted to over clock, I think the fans and heat sink look reasonable, temperature is good without overclocking.  I benchmarked it (as far as I know how) in both a PCIe 4 slot and a PCI 3 slot, only a few percent difference.  So I think it could be an good upgrade for older computers with no PCIe 4.  I have a gigabyte vision D Z90 board, but I have it installed it in PCIe 3 x16 slot, because my PCIe4 slot is too close to the CPU cooler.  Again, I do not game much, so I'm not worried about 2-4% performance hits.  I might get a raiser cable at some point and mount it vertically, but there does not seem to be a big reason to do this.  I think it a good entry level modern graphics card that is also good for upgrades.  But it cost way too much, over MSRP and MSRP is high.I suggest you download directly from NVIDA the newest drivers, then in safe mode uninstall any NVIDIA software you already have before install this board.  I also had some trouble with bios, but I think that was a problem with gigabyte bios.  I used it with 3 monitors just to test it and it worked.

Fue una compra bastante impulsiva de mi parte pero no me arrepiento el call of dutty warzone me corre todo alto sin tirones ni nada ademas que los juegos catalogados como e-sports todos corren sobre los 180fps esta bastante buena para ser una gama seudo economica ademas de tener el raytracing que le da un plus en varias cosas como el residen evil village que se ve casi como pel√≠cula muy buena compra y tienen una tarjeta de video menor a una 2050 es recomendable ya que las 2060 y superiores ya es otra categoria y se nota entre 5 a 20 fps fps mas que nada

Aunque el MSRP sea de 250$, en el contexto actual realmente vale la pena invertir ese dinero extra en esta 3050, ofrece un excelente rendimiento en resoluci√≥n 1080p, su capacidad de 8GB de vram permiten que los juegos se puedan jugar con ajustes gr√°ficos en ultra, adem√°s de que tecnolog√≠as como DLSS realmente ayudan a amortiguar la carga en juegos muy pesados, incluso si quieres jugar con Ray Tracing.
